Attribution of minor citations for personal or non-commercial use can be provided as simply “LSV” or “Literal Standard Version.” Citations for commercial use, or distribution of the entire LSV Bible or entire book(s) of the LSV Bible, must be fully attributed and include both “Literal Standard Version (LSV)” and the name of our organization. Covenant Press is soliciting partnerships with Bible publishers that are interested in the LSV project. For queries about partnering with us, please email the translation team at covenantpress@ccc.one. To learn more, visit [LSVBible.com](https://lsvbible.com). 

The purpose behind the LSV is to provide readers with a modern, easy-to-read, literal, and accurate translation of the Bible that is free to read, distribute, and translate from. We pray that God will use the LSV to illuminate the hearts and minds of multitudes with the good news that His Son Jesus Christ came in the flesh, died for our sins as a substitutionary sacrifice, rose bodily from the dead, and is coming back again.
