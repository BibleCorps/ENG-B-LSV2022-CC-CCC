\im3 IN ACCORDANCE WITH the Scriptures, Christ the Messiah, the Son of the living God, became human, incarnate in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, lived a morally perfect and sinless life, died for our sins on the Cross as a substitutionary sacrifice, was buried in a tomb, and was raised bodily from the dead on the third day. Everyone who hears and accepts this message of salvation, believing in their heart that God raised the Christ from the dead, will be pardoned of all their sins, given the gift of the Holy Spirit, and granted everlasting life with God. Salvation is found in Christ alone by grace alone through faith alone and not by works.

\imt9 The Preface to the
\imt3 Literal Standard Version
\ie
\im MANY HAVE UNDERTAKEN translation of the sacred Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek writings—known collectively as \bk The Holy Bible\bk*—into English, with varying degrees of success. The word \bk Bible\bk* comes from the Greek \wg βιβλία\wg*, the plural form of \wg βιβλίον\wg* (“book” or “scroll”). Thus, the Holy Books or Holy Scrolls are the protocanonical collection of God-breathed writings central to Judeo-Christian belief. Christians regard the original autographic manuscripts to be directly inspired by God, inerrant (“without error”), and infallible (“without fault”; i.e., incapable of fallacy). The absolute truth of God revealed therein is the basis for the Protestant/Evangelical doctrine of Sola Scriptura (“by Scripture alone”)—the fundamental belief that God’s word stands alone as the ultimate arbiter of religious, spiritual, and historical truth because that knowledge which is directly revealed by God to mankind is perfect and without flaw. All beliefs and theories regarding origins and religion are only true insofar as they agree with Scripture, and are false inasmuch as they disagree.
\ip While Christians recognize the infallibility of the autographs, there is also necessary recognition that the original writings have been lost to history. What we now possess are manuscript copies or copies of copies of the originals. Some of these copies were made shortly after the originals and others were written many decades later. To complicate matters, there are distinct manuscript versions and text-types of the Old and New Testaments with minor discrepancies. For the Old Testament we must consider the distinctives between various manuscript versions such as the Masoretic Text (MT), Septuagint (LXX), Samaritan Pentateuch (SP), and Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS). And for the New Testament, translators compare the Alexandrian, Western, and Byzantine text-types.
\ip The goal of any good translation is to produce a readable text that preserves the original autographic meaning and comes as close as possible to translating, word-for-word, manuscripts that accurately represent the original writings. It’s with this goal in mind that the Literal Standard Version (LSV) was written—a modern, yet literal English translation based upon the most prolific texts: the Masoretic Text (MT) for the Old Testament and the Textus Receptus (TR) and Majority Text (M) for the New. However, in certain, specific instances other manuscript versions and text-types are used where the evidence seems incontrovertible (e.g., the LXX and DSS in the Hebrew and Aramaic; the Alexandrian in the Greek).
\ip While many may at first feel disoriented by the cacophony of textual questions, it should be stated with utmost certainty that one of the \iqt many\iqt* things that sets The Holy Bible apart as the unique and divinely inspired word of God is that the manuscript evidence for it is simply overwhelming. No other ancient text, religious or otherwise, has as much manuscript support as The Holy Bible. There are literally tens of thousands of papyri fragments, external citations, and complete copies of ancient manuscripts in the original languages and though there are minor variations, the texts, across all versions, are largely identical. Recent discoveries, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, add further weight to the authenticity of the Scriptures and the accuracy of the translation-base from which we translate to English.
\imt7 Distinctive features of the Literal Standard Version of The Holy Bible:
\ili0 A modern, literal, word-for-word (formal equivalence) English translation of the Holy Scriptures utilizing English word rearrangement when necessitated for readability. The LSV is the most literal translation of The Holy Bible, with significant improvement over previous literal translations, including Robert Young’s excellent Young’s Literal Translation.
\ili0 Preservation of verb tenses wherever possible.
\ili0 Utilization of the transliterated Tetragrammaton in the Old Testament. All uppercase \nd Lord\nd* is used in the New Testament when a reference to \nd Yhwh\nd* is likely.
\ili0 Generally consistent approach to formal equivalence translation; most English translations use a broad set of words when translating a single Greek or Hebrew word based on context. We are striving to only use varying words when the context demands it.
\ili0 Removal of many Hebrew and Greek transliterations; remember, \iqt transliterations\iqt* are generally not \iqt translations\iqt*.
\ili0 Unlike most translations, justified typographic alignment consistent with the style of the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek biblical autographs. The ancient caesura mark—  \qac ǁ\qac* —is used for easy readability of poetic literature such as the Psalms.
\ili0 Inclusion of the verses found in older English translations such as the King James Version (KJV) that are not found in many modern translations; and inclusion of the alternative LXX Genesis chronology set next to the MT. These are contained within bolded double brackets for distinction.
\ili0 Capitalized pronouns and other nounal forms when referring to God, Christ, or the Holy Spirit. References to the Messenger of the \nd Lord\nd* are also capitalized when the subject appears to be a clear reference to God or the Messiah (as found in translations such as the NKJV).
\imt7 Why should we trust in The Holy Bible over other religious, historical, and scientific texts?
\im The Holy Bible is the complete account of God’s revelation to mankind, telling the whole story of history from beginning to end. We can know with absolute certainty that the Bible is true because the Bible is God-breathed. In its original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek manuscripts it is inerrant and infallible. The true God spoke true words to fallible human beings (cf. 2 Tim. 3:16–17 and 2 Pet. 1:20–21). Enabled by the Holy Spirit, they were moved to accurately record God’s message. But, understandably, that answer will not satisfy the skeptic. There are at least six key arguments that powerfully vouch for the Bible’s unique authenticity:
\ip 1. Every claim in the Bible that can be demonstrably tested has been verified. In other words, if we presently possess some scientific know-how, archaeological discovery, or corroborating text that can directly test a specific claim from the Bible, the claim has been verified. As a matter of fact, this truth has been a great source of humiliation for secular historians over the past several decades as discovery after discovery has proven the Bible true even after historians had said “it just can’t be.” Whether it be the fallen walls of Jericho, the reign of King Hezekiah, or even the existence of a Jewish temple, every bit of physical evidence that has turned up to answer the Bible’s claims has proven the Bible true.
\ip 2. There are more ancient manuscripts of the Bible than any other ancient text. Furthermore, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1946/47 dealt a significant defeat to the theory of that generation’s textual critics. They taught that the Old Testament was composed much later than Jews and Christians believed and had undergone a significant evolution in content. Not only did the Dead Sea Scrolls disprove that claim, showing that the Old Testament we have today is equivalent to the one used by Christ and His disciples, but they also provided rock-solid evidence that numerous prophecies about Jesus Christ were written before He was born.
\ip 3. The Bible contains self-verifying mathematical and thematic codes underlying the text. In recent years scholars have discovered numerous number patterns in the text in various books such as Genesis and the synoptic gospels, that would be impossible for humans to have developed on their own. There are similar thematic codes that testify to the Bible’s divine origins.
\ip 4. Despite having been written over a period of 1,600 years by 40 different authors, the Bible forms a single metanarrative. It forms a continuous story with a clear beginning, ending, climax, protagonist, antagonist and complex, repeating themes that recur in almost every book. Yet its authors’ lives were separated by many centuries, occurring on three different continents and in several different ancient cultures. This incredible collection of history, poetry, prophecy, and letters forms a single, overarching story from beginning to end. The protagonist and antagonist show up at the beginning of the story, continue their parts throughout, and reach a climactic moment, culminating with a final showdown at the very end. Dozens of themes, symbols, and patterns recur through the entire text, from Genesis to Revelation. No other religious text can boast of such miraculous development.
\ip 5. The Bible forms a doctrinal hologram. Typical religious texts are one or two-dimensional. If you take out a passage from the text the religion is fundamentally altered—removing key doctrines. It is like a painting on a canvas—mar a section of the picture and you can no longer see the whole. Strangely, the Bible is different. From a doctrinal perspective it forms something analogous to a three-dimensional hologram. You can remove any piece of a hologram, move to a different viewing angle and still see the whole. Doctrines revealed in the Bible are spread out across the entire book, like an interconnected web. This is strong evidence that the book’s underlying author intended His message to get through even if someone tampered with the text. This complex web or layering is hinted at in Isaiah 28: “...precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little, there a little.”
\ip 6. Prophecy is unique to the Bible and is its watermark of authenticity. Other religious texts contain “prophecy,” but unique to the Bible are very specific prophecies that can be demonstrably proven to have been written before the events occurred. Isaiah 53 is an important example. Written some 700 years before Jesus Christ was born, it correctly prophesied that He would come from humble origins, die as a substitutionary sacrifice for our sins, be buried in a rich man’s tomb, rise to life again, and be glorified. There are hundreds of other such prophecies.

\ie
\im THE FOLLOWING TRANSLATION of the New Testament is based upon the belief that every word of the original is “God-breathed,” as the Apostle Paul says in his Second Epistle to Timothy, chap. 3:16. That language is, indeed, applicable, in the first place, only to the Writings of the “Old Testament,” in which Timothy had been instructed, but as the Apostle Peter, in his Second Epistle, chap. 3:15-16, expressly ranks the “Epistles” of his beloved brother Paul along with “the other Scriptures,” as the “Gospels” and the “Acts” of the Apostles were undoubtedly written before the date of Peter’s writing, by men to whom the Saviour promised and gave the Holy Spirit, to \iqt guide\iqt* them to all truth, to teach them all things, and to \iqt remind\iqt* them of all things that Jesus said and did, there can be no reasonable ground for denying the inspiration of the New Testament by any one who holds that of the Old, or who is willing to take the plain unsophisticated meaning of God’s Word regarding either.
\ip This inspiration extends only to the original text, \iqt as it came from the pens of the writers\iqt*, not to any translations ever made by man, however aged, venerable, or good; and only in so far as any of these adhere to the original—neither adding to nor omitting from it one particle—are they of any \iqt real value\iqt*, for, to the extent that they vary from the original, the doctrine of verbal inspiration is lost, so far as that version is concerned.
\ip If a translation gives a \iqt present tense\iqt* when the original gives a \iqt past\iqt*, or a \iqt past\iqt* when it has a \iqt present\iqt*; a \iqt perfect\iqt* for a \iqt future\iqt*, or a \iqt future\iqt* for a \iqt perfect\iqt*; an \iqt a\iqt* for a \iqt the\iqt*, or a \iqt the\iqt* for an \iqt a\iqt*; an \iqt imperative\iqt* for a \iqt subjunctive\iqt*, or a \iqt subjunctive\iqt* for an \iqt imperative\iqt*; a \iqt verb\iqt* for a \iqt noun\iqt*, or a \iqt noun\iqt* for a \iqt verb\iqt*, it is clear that verbal inspiration is as much overlooked as if it had no existence. THE WORD OF GOD IS MADE VOID BY THE TRADITIONS OF MEN.
\ip A \iqt strictly literal\iqt* rendering may not be so pleasant to the ear as one where the \iqt apparent sense\iqt* is chiefly aimed at, yet it is not \iqt euphony\iqt* but \iqt truth\iqt* that ought to be sought, and where in such a version as the one commonly in use in this country, there are scarcely \iqt two consecutive verses\iqt* where there is not some departure from the original such as those indicated, and where these variations may be counted by \iqt tens of thousands\iqt*, as admitted on all hands, it is difficult to see how verbal inspiration can be of the least practical use to those who depend upon that version alone.
\ip Modern scholarship is beginning to be alive to the inconsistency of thus gratuitously obscuring, and really changing, the meaning, of the sacred writers by subjective notions of what they \iqt ought\iqt* to have written, rather than what they \iqt did\iqt* write, for if we admit that in a single case it can be lawful to render a \iqt past\iqt* tense by a \iqt present\iqt*, where shall we end? who is to be judge? if we do so in one passage, to bring out what may appear to us might, could, would, or should, be the Scriptural meaning, we cannot deny the same privilege to others who may twist other passages in like manner. The alteration of an \iqt a\iqt* for a \iqt the\iqt* may appear a small matter not worth speaking of, but an attentive comparison of the following Translation with the common one will discover numerous passages where the \iqt entire force\iqt* of the verse depends upon the insertion or non-insertion of the article.
\ip For example, in Mat. 2:4, Herod is represented as enquiring “where Christ ' should be born. But “Christ” is the surname of the man Jesus, who was quite unknown to Herod, who could not consequently ask for a person of whose existence he was ignorant. The true explanation is, that King James' Translators omitted the definite article which occurs in the original. The correct translation is, where “the Christ” should be born. Herod knew of “\iqt the\iqt* Christ,” \iqt the\iqt* Messiah, \iqt the\iqt* long promised Saviour and King of the Jews, and his enquiry was, where He was to be born, whose kingdom was to be over all. The simple article clears up the whole. There are about \iqt two thousand\iqt* instances in the New Testament where these translators have thus omitted all notice of the definite article, not to say any thing of the great number of passages where they have \iqt inserted\iqt* it, though not in the original.
\ip The following translation need not, and ought not, to be considered, in any sense, as coming into competition with the Common Version, but as one to be used in connection with it, and as auxiliary to it; and not a few assurances have been received from clergymen and others that they thus use it, and find it at once interesting and profitable. The change of a single word, or collocation of words, is often found to throw an entirely new shade of meaning over the Scripture. This advantage is well known to all who have compared the various ancient versions, or even the English versions that successively formed what was popularly called “the authorized version,” i.e., Tyndale, Coverdale, Geneva, Bishops, etc.
\ip The Greek Text followed is that generally recognized as the “Received Text,” not because it is thought perfect, but because the department of Translation is quite distinct from that of Textual Criticism, and few are qualified for both. If the original text be altered by a translator, (except he give his reasons for and against each emendation,) the reader is left in uncertainty whether the translation given is to be considered as that of the old or of the new reading. And, after all, the differences in sense to be found in the 100,000 various Greek readings are so trifling compared with those to be derived from an \iqt exact\iqt* translation of the Received Text, that the writer willingly leaves them to other hands; at the same time, it is contemplated, in a future edition, to give, in an Appendix, all the various readings of the Greek MSS. that are capable of being expressed in English.
\ip With grateful thanks to the Father of Lights, this revised edition is presented to the friends of Divine Truth, with the hope that it may be a means, in the hands of the Divine Spirit, of quickening their faith, and encouraging their hearts, in the work of the Lord.

\im THE WORK, in its present form, is not to be considered as intended to come into competition with the \iqt ordinary\iqt* use of the commonly received English Version of the Holy Scriptures, but simply as a strictly literal and idiomatic rendering of the Original Hebrew and Greek Texts. For about twenty years—fully half his life-time—the Translator has had a desire to execute such a work, and has been engaged in Biblical pursuits tending to this end more or less exclusively; and now, at last, in the good providence of God, the desire has been accomplished. How far he has been able to carry out the just principles of Biblical Translation, founded on a solid and immovable foundation, time alone will tell, and for this he confidently waits. As these \iqt principles\iqt* are to some extent new, and adhered to with a severity never hitherto attempted, and as the Translator has perfect confidence in their accuracy and simplicity, he proceeds at once to state them distinctly and broadly, that not merely the learned, but the wayfaring man need not err in appreciating their value.
\ip There are two modes of translation which may be adopted in rendering into our own language the writings of an ancient author; the one is, to bring him before us in such a manner as that we may \iqt regard him as our own\iqt*; the other, to \iqt transport ourselves\iqt*, on the contrary, \iqt over to him, adopting his situation, modes of speaking, thinking, acting\iqt*—\iqt peculiarities of age and race, air, gesture, voice, etc\iqt*. Each of these plans has its advantages, but the latter is incomparably the better of the two, being suited—not for the ever-varying modes of thinking and acting of the men of the fifth, or the tenth, or the fifteenth, or some other century, but—for all ages alike. All attempts to make Moses or Paul act, or speak, or reason, as if they were Englishmen of the nineteenth century, must inevitably tend to change the translator into a paraphrast or a commentator, characters which, however useful, stand altogether apart from that of him, who, with a work before him in one language, seeks only to transfer it into another.
\ip In prosecuting the plan thus adopted, a literal translation was indispensable. No other kind of rendering could place the reader in the position contemplated, side by side with the writer—prepared to think as \iqt he\iqt* does, to see as \iqt he\iqt* sees, to reason, to feel, to weep, and to exult along with him. His very conception of time, even in the minor accidents of the grammatical past, present, future, are to become our own. If he speaks of an event, as \iqt now\iqt* passing, we are not, on the logical ground of its having in reality already transpired, to translate his present as if it were a past; or if, on the other hand, his imagination pictures the future as if even at this moment present, we are not translators but expounders, and that of a tame description, if we take the liberty to convert his time, and tense—the grammatical expression of his time—into our own. King James' translators were almost entirely unacquainted with the two distinctive peculiarities of the Hebrew mode of thinking and speaking, admitted by the most profound Hebrew scholars in \iqt theory\iqt*, though, from undue timidity, never carried out in \iqt practice\iqt*, viz:
\ili0 \k 1.\k** That the Hebrews were in the habit of using the past tense to express the \iqt certainty\iqt* of an action taking place, even though the action might not really be performed for some time.
\ili0 \k 2.\k** And that the Hebrews, in referring to events which might be either \iqt past\iqt* or \iqt future\iqt* were accustomed to act on the principle of transferring themselves mentally to the period and place of the events themselves, and were not content with coldly viewing them as those of a bygone or still coming time; hence the very frequent use of the \iqt present\iqt* tense.
\b
\im These two great principles of the Hebrew language are substantially to be found in the works of Lee, Gesenius, Ewald, etc.; but the present writer has carried them out in translation much beyond what any of these ever contemplated, on the simple ground that, if they are true, they ought to be gone through with. While they affect very considerably the outward \iqt form\iqt* of the translation, it is a matter of thankfulness that they do not touch the \iqt truth\iqt* of a single Scripture doctrine—\iqt not even one\iqt*.
\ip Every effort has been made to secure a comparative degree of uniformity in rendering the original words and phrases. Thus, for example, the Hebrew verb \iqt nathan\iqt*, which is rendered by King James' translators in \iqt sixty-seven\iqt* different ways (see in the subsequent page, entitled ‘Lax Renderings,’) has been restricted and reduced to \iqt ten\iqt*, and so with many others. It is the Translator’s ever-growing conviction, that even this smaller number may be reduced still further.
\ip It has been no part of the Translator’s plan to attempt to form a New Hebrew or Greek Text—he has therefore somewhat rigidly adhered to the received ones. Where he has differed, it is generally in reference to the punctuation and accentuation, the division of words and sentences, which, being merely traditional, are, of course, often imperfect. For an explanation and vindication of these differences, the reader is referred to the “Concise Commentary,” which is designed to supplement the present volume.
\ip The Translator has often had occasion to regret the want of a marginal column to insert the various renderings of passages where he has been unable to satisfy his own mind—he has, however, cast the chief of these into an appendix, under the title, “Additions and Corrections.” and still more elaborately in the supplementary volume.

\imt3 Introduction to the Literal Standard Version
\ie
\ip THE LITERAL STANDARD VERSION of The Holy Bible is a major revision of Young’s Literal Translation (YLT). It maintains many of Robert Young’s great contributions to the field of Bible translation and research. The relationship of the LSV to Young’s Literal Translation is similar to that of the English Standard Version (ESV) to the Revised Standard Version or the New King James Version (NKJV) and Modern English Version (MEV) to the KJV. Young’s Literal Translation was the most literal translation of The Holy Bible ever made into English up to this point for three key reasons: 1. Preservation of verb tenses, 2. Consistent word-for-word translation, and 3. General preservation of word order.
\ip The LSV maintains the first two rules while having more flexibility with the third, which actually results in a more literal end-result. To understand why, you must first understand the nature of language. Language is a series of written and/or spoken words that convey meaning. Words \iqt and\iqt* meaning are inherent to the definition of language. Furthermore, words have meaning by themselves, but also when structured together. A word by itself contains meaning but has no context. As grand an undertaking as the YLT was, it suffered from overdependence on word order at the expense of readability. This begs the question: if word order is maintained, but a sentence is unreadable, is a translation truly made? Languages not only differ in alphabet, but also in word order and sentence structure. For instance, in the Latin languages “I love you” would be structured “You I love.” In the Germanic family it would be the former. In more complicated sentences, the differing word order can result in unintelligible translation if the word order is maintained. Since context and sentence structure are as vital to translation as capturing the proper meaning of each word, the translators of the LSV have used these three key principles in translation: 1. Preservation of verb tenses, 2. Consistent word-for-word translation, and 3. Preservation of word order when readability is unimpacted, but revised word order when necessary for readability.
\ip The use of these three principles in combination with other LSV peculiarities \iqt discussed below\iqt* has resulted in the most literal translation of The Holy Bible into modern English, as well as the most distinctive.
\imt7 Another translation, \em why?\em*
\ip There have been a slew of new English translations in the past half-century, which may cause some to wonder why the need for another. The translators agree with the premise that different translations can serve different demographics and different reading levels to maximize exposure to God’s word. In this sense, the LSV is not a competitor to other excellent translations, but is complimentary. As the most literal modern English translation, the LSV is an excellent resource for deep and thoughtful Bible study and research, essentially an interlinear in terms of word-for-word translation, but arranged with English sentence structure. At the same time, some newer translations and revisions are twisting the Holy Scriptures in order to appease a postmodern, progressive, and secular readership. The LSV is a line in the sand against such perversion. Let God’s word speak on its own terms. The LSV has been translated to improve upon what has come before and to ensure that God’s word in English is passed along to the next generation.
\imt7 The Name of God
\ip One of the first things a reader may notice about the LSV is the use of the transliterated Tetragrammaton (“\nd Yhwh\nd*”) instead of “\nd Lord\nd*.” This decision was made on the premise that God did in fact reveal His Name as \nd Yhwh\nd* to the Israelites of antiquity and many Scriptures emphasize the importance and sacredness of His Name. Replacing His actual Name with an English title does disservice to the Name and to the many Scriptures that emphasize the Name. At the same time, an impersonal title such as “\nd Lord\nd*” may cause the reader to view an ever-present and very personal God impersonally. We want the reader to recognize that God has indeed given us His Name and we must respect His decision. Moreover, while a handful of translations use a pronounceable name, we thought it best to recognize that none of these names are universally accepted in scholarship and the original unpointed Hebrew did not provide us with the vowels. \iqt Yahweh\iqt*, \iqt Yehovah\iqt*, and others, are mere suggestions based on differing bodies of research. While “Yahweh” or something of very similar pronunciation seems the most likely, or at least as close as we may come at the present time, we have chosen to use the transliterated Tetragrammaton because it is more than likely accurate, represents the original unpointed Name, and leaves it to the reader to respectfully and thoughtfully pronounce the Name according to the research they are more personally persuaded by. At the same time, we have opted to retain many Anglicized names, including the Name of God’s Son, \iqt Jesus\iqt*. Our reasons are threefold: \iqt first\iqt*, it is already a name and not a title; \iqt second\iqt*, the Name is in near-universal use in the English-speaking world; and \iqt third\iqt*, it is a close transliteration of the original Greek \iqt Iesous\iqt*.
\imt7 Justified typographic alignment, the caesura mark, and other formatting peculiarities
\ip The LSV may be the only English translation of The Holy Bible entirely formatted with justified typographic alignment throughout. This same format is maintained in poetic literature. While some readers may prefer paragraph breaks in narrative and line breaks in poetic portions for the purpose of readability, it was the decision of the translators to mimic the style of the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek autographs in presenting God’s word as a continuous text block. This decision wasn’t arbitrary. In formatting the text this way, the LSV sets itself against the modern push for more and more formatting within the text, in favor of simplicity. Furthermore, the modern trend even extended to differentiating the words of Christ in red letters, as if God’s word should be divided in such a way. The LSV is the polar opposite, regarding the entirety of Scripture as God-breathed, with its different genres of literature resting on a level playing field.
\ip In summary, this formatting decision was made to mimic the style of the original autographs, elevate the entirety of Scripture as God-breathed, exclude the possibility of formatting passages in a way contrary to the author’s intended delivery, and finally: it was made for ease of sharing in an era where digital reading is as common as reading from paper. Whether it be a printed copy, an eBook, an app, or some other format, the LSV is the easiest translation to copy and share ever made. In addition, justified typographic alignment throughout reduces the overall length of the printed and digital editions by a substantial margin, offering considerable cost savings to publishers and distributors seeking to get God’s word into as many hands as possible.
\ip Like alignment, the LSV adopts a more ancient approach to handle quotations. Recent translations continue the trend of deeply-nested quotation marks, which many readers find confusing. The original biblical autographs contained no punctuation denoting the opening or closing of a quotation, whereas many modern translations use alternating double quotes (“ ”) and single quotes (‘ ’) to nest quotes two, three, or even four levels deep. The LSV utilizes a middle approach between modern translations and the older English translations like the KJV, which didn’t use quotation marks at all. The LSV uses double quotes to denote the outermost quotation within a single chapter (similar to recent translations), and a capitalized opening word of a nested quote (similar to the King James Version). This lends itself to a simpler, more elegant, and easier-to-follow text.
\ip For ease of readability, the LSV includes the double pipe (“\qac ǁ\qac* ”) \iqt caesura mark\iqt* to separate phrases within poetic portions of Scripture. The caesura mark was extensively used this way in ancient Greek, Latin, and English poetry. Verse numbers, periods, colons, semicolons, question marks, exclamation marks, and em dashes generally stand in for caesura marks in these passages if they are followed by a capital letter.
\ip Finally, clarifying, interpolated words are placed in unbolded brackets (“[ ]”) to make clear that they do not form part of the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek text. Bolded double brackets (“\k [[ \k** \k ]] \k**”) are reserved for identifying words, phrases, and passages whose inclusion in the original text is disputed.
\imt7 Definite articles and prepositions
\ip The greatest flexibility in translation can be found in regard to definite articles and prepositions. The LSV is generally more literal with definite articles than the YLT. Definite articles are often surrounded by brackets when they are missing from the original text (although not always—when the use of the definite article in English is demanded). When the definite article’s usage is flexible, the LSV generally defers to the original text in its absence or inclusion.
\ip While the LSV doesn’t use a single word to consistently translate each preposition, the LSV does strive to maintain consistency in semantic range (in other words, a certain set of English prepositions are matched to each Bible language preposition, and the consistency is maintained wherever possible). This consistency results in the LSV being equally literal and readable.
\imt7 Church , repentance , baptism, and age
\ip The LSV chooses a literal translation even for “theologically loaded” words like ἐκκλησία (LSV: “assembly”), μετάνοια (LSV: “conversion”), βάπτισμα (LSV: “immersion”), and עוֹלָם and αἰών (LSV: “age” or “continuous,” depending on the context). These decisions were not made to disparage the common translations and were not made lightly. They were made to give the reader the best sense of what the original words mean in English, without the use of words that are the result of centuries of theological tradition. The frequent translation of metanoia as “repentance” has been particularly troubling to scholars who emphasize the fundamental differences in their etymology and meaning, with the original Greek word referring to persuasion, conversion, or a change of mind or belief.

\imt3 Style of the Sacred Writers, and of this Translation.
\ie
\im ONE OF THE FIRST things that is likely to attract the attention of the Readers of this New Translation is its lively, picturesque, dramatic style, by which the inimitable beauty of the Original Text is more vividly brought out than by any previous Translation. It is true that the Revisers appointed by King James have occasionally imitated it, but only in a few familiar phrases and colloquialisms, chiefly in the Gospel Narrative, and without having any settled principles of translation to guide them on the point. The exact force of the Hebrew tenses has long been a vexed question with critics, but the time cannot be far distant when the \iqt general\iqt* principles of the late learned Professor Samuel Lee of Cambridge, with some modification, will be generally adopted \iqt in substance\iqt*, if not in theory. It would be entirely out of place here to enter into details on this important subject, but a very few remarks appear necessary, and may not be unacceptable to the student.
\ip \k 1.\k** It would appear that the Hebrew writers, when narrating or describing events which might be either \iqt past\iqt* or \iqt future\iqt* (such as the case of Moses in reference to the \iqt Creation\iqt* or the \iqt Deluge\iqt*, on the one hand, and to the \iqt Coming of the Messiah\iqt* or the \iqt Calamities which were to befall Israel\iqt*, on the other), uniformly wrote as if they were alive at the time of the occurrence of the events mentioned, and as \iqt eye-witnesses\iqt* of what they are narrating.
\ip It would be needless to refer to special passages in elucidation or vindication of this principle essential to the proper understanding of the Sacred Text, as every page of this Translation affords abundant examples. It is only what common country people do in this land at the present day, and what not a few of the most popular writers in England aim at and accomplish—placing themselves and their readers in the times and places of the circumstances related.
\ip This principle of translation has long been admitted by the best Biblical Expositors in reference to the \iqt Prophetic Delineation\iqt* of Gospel times, but it is equally applicable and necessary to the historical narratives of Genesis, Ruth, etc.
\ip \k 2.\k** The Hebrew writers often express the \iqt certainty of a thing taking place\iqt* by putting it in the \iqt past\iqt* tense, though the actual fulfillment may not take place for ages. This is easily understood and appreciated when the language is used by God, as when He says, in Gen. xv. 18, “Unto thy seed \iqt I have given\iqt* this land;” and in xvii. 4, “I, lo, My covenant \iqt is\iqt* with thee, and \iqt thou hast become\iqt* a father of a multitude of nations.”
\ip The same thing is found in Gen. xxiii. 11, where Ephron answers Abraham: “Nay, my lord, hear me; the field \iqt I have given\iqt* to thee, and the cave that is in it; to thee \iqt I have given\iqt* it; before the eyes of the sons of my people \iqt I have given\iqt* it to thee; bury thy dead.” And again in Abraham’s answer to Ephron: “Only—if thou wouldst hear me—\iqt I have given\iqt* the money of the field; accept from me, and I bury my dead there.” Again in 2 Kings v. 6, the King of Syria, writing to the King of Israel, says: “Lo, I have sent unto thee Naaman, my servant, and \iqt thou hast recovered him\iqt* from his leprosy,”—considering the King of Israel as his servant, a mere expression of the master’s purpose is sufficient. In Judges viii. 19, Gideon says to Zebah and Zalmunnah, “If ye had kept them alive, \iqt I had not slain you.\iqt*” So in Deut. xxxi. 18, “For all the evils that \iqt they have done\iqt*”—shall have done.
\ip It would be easy to multiply examples, but the above may suffice for the present. Some of these forms of expression are preceded by the conjunction “\iqt and\iqt*” (waw, in Hebrew), and a very common opinion has been that the conjunction in these cases has a \iqt conversive power\iqt*, and that the verb is not to be translated \iqt past\iqt* (though so in grammatical form), but \iqt future\iqt*. This is, of course, only an \iqt evasion \iqt*of the supposed difficulty, not a \iqt solution\iqt*, and requires to be supported by the equally untenable hypothesis that a (so-called) \iqt future\iqt* tense, when preceded by the same conjunction \iqt waw\iqt* (“and,”) often becomes a past. Notwithstanding these two converting hypotheses, there are numerous passages which have no conjunction before them, which can only be explained by the principle stated above.
\ip \k 3.\k** The Hebrew writers are accustomed to express laws, commands, etc., in four ways:
\ili1 By the regular imperative form, e.g., \iqt “Speak\iqt* unto the people.”
\ili1 By the infinitive, “Every male of you \iqt is to be\iqt* circumcised.”
\ili1 By the (so-called) future, \iqt “Let\iqt* there be light;” “Thou \iqt shalt\iqt* do no murder;” “Six days \iqt is\iqt* work done.”
\ili1 By the past tense, “Speak unto the sons of Israel, and \iqt thou hast said\iqt* unto them.”
\b
\im There can be no good reason why these several peculiarities should not be exhibited in the translation of the Bible, or that they should be confounded, as they often are, in the Common Version. In common life among ourselves, these forms of expression are frequently used for imperatives, e.g., “Go and do this,”—“This is to be done first,”—“You shall go,”—“You go and finish it.” There are few languages which afford such opportunities of a literal and idiomatic rendering of the Sacred Scriptures as the English tongue, and the present attempt will be found, it is believed, to exhibit this more than any other Translation.
\ip The three preceding particulars embrace all that appears necessary for the Reader to bear in mind in reference to the Style of the New Translation. In the Supplementary “Concise Critical Commentary,” which is now in the course of being issued, abundant proofs and illustrations will be found adduced at length.
\imt7 The Battle of the Hebrew Tenses.
\im The uncertain state of Hebrew criticism in reference to the Tenses is so fully exhibited in the following extracts from one of the latest, and in some respects one of the best, grammatical Commentaries (by the Rev. J. A. Alexander, of Princeton, New Jersey), on the Book of Isaiah, that the reader’s attention to them is specially requested.
\ip On Isa. 5:13, Prof. A. remarks: ‘Luther, Gesenius, and Hendewerk take [the verb] as a future, which is not to be assumed without necessity. Most recent writers evade the difficulty by rendering it in the present tense. The only natural construction is the old one (Septuagint, Vulgate, Vitringa, Barnes), which gives the preterite its proper meaning, and either supposes the future to be here, \iqt as often elsewhere\iqt*, spoken of as already past,’ etc.
\im2 [This principle, though admitted and maintained by Gesenius, Lee, etc. has never been acted upon, to any extent, by any Translator till the present. It is the only principle, however, that can carry us through every difficulty in the Sacred Scriptures.]
\ip On chap. 5:25, ‘The future form given to the verbs by Clericus is altogether arbitrary. Most of the later writers follow Luther in translating them as presents. But, if this verse is not descriptive of the past, as distinguished from the present and the future, the Hebrew language is incapable of making any such distinction.’
\im2 [Let this principle be carried out, as it ought to be, and nine-tenths of the common critical works on the Bible are rendered perfectly useless, and positively injurious.]
\ip On chap. 5:26, ‘Here, as in v.25, the older writers understand the verbs as future, but the later ones as present. The verbs in the last clause have waw prefixed, but its conversive power commonly depends upon a future verb preceding, which is wanting here.’
\im2 [And so it is in dozens of places where Prof. A. follows in the usual wake of critics.]
\ip On chap. 5:27, ‘The English Version follows Calvin in translating all the verbs as \iqt future\iqt*. The Vulgate supplies the present in the first clause, and makes the others future. But as the whole is evidently one description, the translation should be uniform, and as the preterite and future forms are intermingled, both \iqt seem\iqt* to be here used for the \iqt present\iqt*, which is given by Luther, and most of the late writers.’
\im2 [Here, leaving all certainty and settled principles behind him, Prof. A. tells us how he thinks the inspired writer ought to have written, not what he did write.]
\ip On chap. 8:2, ‘The Vulgate takes the verb as a \iqt preterite\iqt*, and Gesenius, Maurer, Knobel read accordingly with waw conversive. The Septuagint, Targum, and Peshito make it \iqt imperative\iqt*, and Hitzig accordingly. Gesenius formerly preferred an indirect or \iqt subjunctive\iqt* construction, which is still retained by Henderson.’
\im2 [Here are \iqt four\iqt* ancient versions and, \iqt five\iqt* modern critics at fives and sixes regarding what is as simple as can well be imagined!]
\ip On chap. 9:7, ‘Another false antithesis is that between the verbs, referring one to \iqt past\iqt* time, and the other to the future. This is adopted even by Ewald, but according to the usage of the language [rather of modern Hebrew grammar], \iqt Waw\iqt* is conversive of the preterite only when preceded by a future, expressed or \iqt implied\iqt*.’
\im2 [By this very extraordinary rule the critic can never have any difficulty, for it is very easy to consider a verbal form implied when it suits his convenience! Yet this egregious absurdity is very commonly adopted in all existing translations, including the Common English Version; e.g., Gen. 9:12–14, where the Hebrew Text has four verbs all in the past tense, yet the first is translated as a present (‘I do set’), and the remaining three as futures! The first verb is undoubtedly in the past, ‘I have set,’ the other three as undoubtedly, seeing the Waw by which they are preceded cannot be conversive, except when preceded by a future or an imperative, neither of which occur in this place. The solution of the supposed difficulty is only to be found in the principle stated above by Prof. A., and which is the basis of the New Translation, and maintained by Gesenius and Lee, that the Hebrews were in the habit of using the past to denote the certainty of an event taking place.]
\ip On chap. 9:19, ‘Ewald refers the first clause to the past, and the second to the present. Umbreit the first to the present, and the second to the future. But the very intermingling of the past and the future forms shows that the whole was meant to be descriptive.’
\im2 [Would they not be descriptive had they been all past, or all present, or all future?]
\ip On chap. 10:14, ‘The \iqt present\iqt* form, which Hendewerk adopts throughout the verses, is equally grammatical,’
\im2 [\iqt though the first verb is a\iqt* perfect, \iqt and the second a\iqt* perfect!]
\ip On chap. 14:24, ‘Kimchi explains [the verb] to be a preterite used for a future, and this construction is adopted in most versions, ancient and modern. It is, however, altogether arbitrary, and in violation of the only safe rule as to the use of the tenses, viz., that they should have their proper and distinctive force, unless forbidden by the context or the nature of the subject, which is very far from being the case here, as we shall see below. Gesenius and De Wette evade the difficulty by rendering both the verbs as presents, a construction which is often admissible, and even necessary(!) in a descriptive context, but when used indiscriminately or inappropriately, tends both to weaken and obscure the sense. Ewald and Umbreit make the first verb present, and the second future, which is scarcely, if at all, less objectionable.’
\ip The above extracts are surely sufficient to show that Hebrew criticism, as hitherto taught, is capable of being used to any purpose, or moulded to any form the Critic may wish. Such a state of things surely cannot continue any longer, or be adopted by any one who regards simplicity more than ingenious guesses, truth more than tradition.
\imt7 View of Hebrew Tenses As Seen in the New Translation.
\im The Hebrew has only two tenses, which, for want of better terms, may be called \iqt Past\iqt* and \iqt Present\iqt*.
\ip The \iqt past\iqt* is either perfect or imperfect, e.g., ‘I \iqt lived\iqt* in this house five years,’ or ‘I \iqt have lived\iqt* in this house five years;’ this distinction may and can only be known by the context, which must in all cases be viewed from the writer’s standing-point.
\ip In \iqt every\iqt* other instance of its occurrence, it points out either:
\ili0 \k 1.\k** \iqt A gentle imperative\iqt*, e.g., “Lo, I have sent unto thee Naaman my servant, and thou \iqt hast\iqt* recovered him from his leprosy;” see also Zech. 1:3, etc.; or
\ili0 \k 2.\k** \iqt A fixed determination\iqt* that a certain thing shall be done, e.g., “Nay, my lord, hear me, the field \iqt I have given\iqt* to thee, and the cave that is in it; to thee \iqt I have given\iqt* it; before the eyes of the sons of my people \iqt I have given\iqt* it to thee; bury thy dead;” and in the answer, “Only—if thou wouldst hear me—\iqt I have given\iqt* the money of the field.”
\ip The \iqt present\iqt* tense—as in the Modern Arabic, Syriac, and Amharic, the only living remains of the Semitic languages—besides its proper use, is used rhetorically for the future, there being no grammatical form to distinguish them; this, however, causes no more difficulty than it does in English, Turkish, Greek, Sanskrit, etc., the usages of which may be seen in the Extracts from the principal grammarians.
\ip In \iqt every\iqt* other instance of its occurrence, it points out \iqt an imperative\iqt*, not so gently as when a preterite is used for this purpose, nor so stern as when the regular imperative form is employed, but more like the infinitive, Thou art \iqt to write\iqt* no more; thou \iqt mayest\iqt* write no more.
\ip The present participle differs from the present tense just in the same manner and to the same extent as “I am writing, or, I am a writer,” does from, “I write, or, I do write.”
\im The above view of the Hebrew tenses is equally applicable to all the Semitic languages, including the Ancient and Modern Arabic, the Ancient and Modern Syriac, the Ancient and Modern Ethiopic, the Samaritan, the Chaldee, and the Rabbinical Hebrew—not one of which is admitted to have the Waw Conversive.
\ip It may be added, that all the \iqt Teutonic\iqt* languages—fourteen in number—agree with the \iqt Semitic\iqt* in rejecting a future tense; the futurity of an event being indicated either by auxiliary verbs, adverbs, and other particles, or by the context.
\imt7 Analysis of the Verbs in Genesis ix. 12–15.
\iq0 \iqt 12 “And God saith, This is the token of the covenant that I am making between Me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for generations age-during; 13 My bow I have given in the cloud, and it hath been for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth; 14 and it hath come to pass, in My sending a cloud over the earth, that the bow hath been seen in the cloud, 15 and I have remembered My covenant, that is between Me and you, and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters become no more a deluge to destroy all flesh.”\iqt*
\b
\ili0 \iqt Verse 12. And God saith.]\iqt* The present tense is used, according to the almost universal custom of the Hebrews, etc., to bring up the narrative to the present time. The conjunction \iqt and\iqt* has no special or logical significance, but is used simply to break the abruptness of the opening sentence, as the Hebrews scarcely ever allow a verb in the present or past tense to commence a sentence, especially in prose, without some other word preceding it; the only other way would have been to put the nominative before the verb, but this, though occasionally used, is not agreeable to Hebrew taste.
\ili0 \iqt This (is) the token.]\iqt* The Hebrew substantive verb is, in the present tense, very frequently omitted; in the past tense, it is very rarely, if ever, omitted.
\ili0 \iqt That I am making, lit. giving.]\iqt* The participle is more strikingly expressive of present action than if the present tense had been employed.
\ili0 \iqt That (is) with you.]\iqt* The present tense of the substantive verb is understood as above, according to the \iqt unus loquendi\iqt*.
\ili0 \iqt V.13. My bow I have given in the cloud.]\iqt* The past tense here is used to express a \iqt fixed determination\iqt* that the circumstance mentioned is undoubtedly to take place; most unwarrantably does the Common Version translate as a present, ‘I do set;’ while the theory of the \iqt Waw conversive\iqt* has no place here, since there is no \iqt Waw\iqt* to work on.
\ili0 \iqt And it hath become.]\iqt* The fixed determination is here continued from the preceding clause; on no grammatical principle can it be rendered present, much less future, as it is in the Common Version; the Waw here can have no converting power, there being no future preceding it to rest on, as the rules of \iqt Waw conversive\iqt* imperatively demand.
\ili0 \iqt V.14. It hath come to pass—the bow hath been seen—I have remembered]\iqt*—though rendered future in the Common Version, are all past, being preceded by pasts, and are to be explained by the same principle—of expressing the certainty of a future action by putting it in the past, owing to the determination of the speaker that it must be.
\ili0 The only remaining verb in the 15th verse is correctly put in the present tense; the speaker, going forward in thought to the period when the events alluded to take place, declares graphically that ‘the waters \iqt become\iqt* no more a deluge to destroy all flesh.’
\imt7 “Waw Conversive” A Fiction—Not a Fact.
\im The doctrine of “Waw Conversive,” according to the common Hebrew Grammars, is:
\ili0 “The \iqt past\iqt* tense with the prefix \iqt waw\iqt*, expresses future time when preceded by a verb in the \iqt future\iqt* or by an \iqt imperative\iqt*.” And again:
\ili0 “The \iqt future\iqt* tense, with the prefix \iqt waw\iqt*, and dagesh in the following letter, is used to express the \iqt past\iqt*.”
\im2 [See the Grammars of Hurwitz, Gesenius, etc.]
\ili0 \iqt The objections to this doctrine may be summed up in four particulars\iqt*:
\ili1 \k 1.\k** It is insufficient to explain the many thousands of passages in the Hebrew Bible where a \iqt past\iqt* tense is preceded neither by a \iqt future\iqt* nor by an \iqt imperative\iqt*, yet where it is “converted” in the Common English Bible, and with as much propriety as in any of those instances that are supposed to be indisputable: e.g.
\b
\im3 Ge. 3:12, “This (is) the token of the covenant that I am making between Me and you ... my bow \iqt I have set\iqt* in the cloud, and it \iqt hath become\iqt* the token of the covenant ... and it \iqt hath come to pass\iqt* ... and it \iqt hath been seen\iqt* ... and I have remembered ... and the waters do no more,” etc.
\b
\im3 Ge. 17:4, “Lo, My covenant (is) with thee, and \iqt thou hast become\iqt* the father of a multitude of nations.” The true solution of the principle involved in these passages is: That the Hebrews were in the habit of expressing \iqt the certainty of an action taking place\iqt* by putting it in the past tense (see particularly Ge. 23:11, \iqt “I have given ... I have given ... I have given;”\iqt* also in verse 13, \iqt “I have given”\iqt* ), taking its fulfilment for granted.
\b
\ili1 \k 2.\k** It leads to results rather startling, viz. that most, if not all, of the Hebrew particles are conversive! Grammarians have already been driven to admit, or rather assert, that \iqt az\iqt* then, and \iqt terem\iqt* not yet, are conversive as well as \iqt waw\iqt*.

Attempts have been made to find something like it in the use of the Arabic particle \iqt pha\iqt*, but, as Professor Lee has well remarked (in his Hebrew Grammar and Lexicon), the same thing might be alleged of most other Arabic particles, such as \iqt la\iqt*, no, \iqt lam\iqt*, not, \iqt lamma\iqt*, why, \iqt summa\iqt*, then, etc., which no one has ever as yet thought of doing.
\p2 The Arabs, in order to lessen the occasional ambiguity arising from the same form of the verb being used indifferently for the present and the future, sometimes prefix to it the particle \iqt sa\iqt* (a contraction of \iqt soufa\iqt*, at last, hereafter), which makes it strictly future, and sometimes the word \iqt ammal\iqt* (an agent), which makes it strictly present.

\ip \iqt Common Version\iqt*: “As for Me behold, My covenant [is] with thee, and thou SHALT be a father of many nations; neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham, for a father of many nations HAVE I made thee.”
\ip \iqt New Version\iqt*: “I—lo, My covenant [is] with thee, and thou HAST become a father of a multitude of nations, and thy name is no more called Abram, but thy name hath been Abraham, for a father of a multitude of nations HAVE I made thee.”—Gen. 17:4-5.
\ip It is the first and the last of the verbs in the above verses to which the reader’s attention is specially requested, viz, those translated in the Common Version, “Thou \iqt shalt\iqt* be,” and “I \iqt have\iqt* made,” and in the New Version, “Thou \iqt hast\iqt* become,” and “I \iqt have\iqt* made.” Both Versions agree in translating the last verb as a preterite, “I \iqt have\iqt* made;” as the form of the verb is admitted on all hands to be that of a preterite.
\ip The versions differ, however, in the translation of the first verb, the one rendering it by the future “shall,” the other by the preterite “hast.”
\ip The question at issue is: Which of the two is right? \iqt Both\iqt* cannot be right—one \iqt must\iqt* be wrong.
\ip It is undoubtedly in the preterite form, precisely like the last verb in the sentence, admitted on all hands to be a preterite. Why then should this not be translated as a preterite likewise ?
\ip If it be said, that the \iqt sense\iqt* requires it to be translated as a future, seeing it is not literally true that Abraham \iqt was\iqt* a father of many nations at the moment that God addressed these words to him, then, \iqt on precisely the same principle\iqt*, the last verb ought to be translated as a future, “I \iqt will\iqt* make thee,”—not “I \iqt have\iqt* made thee,” as both versions agree in doing—as it is not literally true, that, at the moment when God thus addressed him, He \iqt had\iqt* made him a father of many nations.
\ip If no one will venture to translate the last verb as a future, why should the first be so rendered?
\ip If it be said that the first verb has a conjunction before it, called \iqt Waw\iqt*, signifying “and,” and that the Hebrew Grammarians have laid it down as an idiom of the language, that, in certain circumstances, \iqt Waw\iqt* before a preterite indicates that the preterite is to be reckoned as a future, the answer is: These circumstances do not exist in the present case.
\ip The fundamental Rule laid down by all Hebrew Grammarians to regulate \iqt Waw Conversive\iqt* is: that the first verb to be converted must be preceded by one of a different tense, e.g., a preterite must be preceded by a future, and a future by a preterite.
\ip But, in the passage before us, there is, in the Hebrew, no verb at all preceding the one supposed to be converted, and consequently the Rule cannot operate.
\ip \iqt On no principle of Hebrew Grammar, as commonly taught\iqt*, can the Conversive Principle come into operation in this passage, and it is only one out of \iqt hundreds of similar instances\iqt*.
\ip The solution of the matter is found in the principle: That the Hebrews were in the habit of using the preterite form of the verb to denote a fixed determination that the things mentioned \iqt shall\iqt* and \iqt must\iqt* take place; this principle is common to all the Semitic languages; it is distinctly admitted by the best Hebrew Grammarians; it is common to the New Testament Writers, and to the whole series of Greek and Latin Classics, (see Winer, Stuart, Kuhner, etc.) and it is the only one that meets all cases.
\ip The \iqt Waw Conversive\iqt*, on the contrary, is unknown in \iqt every\iqt* other Hebrew composition—in \iqt every\iqt* other Semitic dialect—in \iqt every\iqt* other language on earth.

\im \k Rabbinical writings.\k**  THE oldest writings in the Hebrew language, after the Old Testament, are the \iqt Talmuds\iqt*, large portions of which we have examined to find some examples of Waw Conversive, but in vain; we have not found a single instance of a preterite converted into a future, or any thing that bears the slightest resemblance to it.
\ip With the same view we have read large portions of the best Rabbinical Commentators, Kimchi, Jarchi, Aben-Ezra; the Jewish Prayer-Books, the Hebrew translations of the New Testament, of the Pilgrim’s Progress, of Dr M’Caul’s Old Paths, and have looked over other Hebrew works too numerous to mention, and all with the same negative result. How is it at all possible that the Hebrew language, as found in the Old Testament, can have a Waw Conversive, if it be wanting in all the oldest and most valued later Hebrew writings? Can credulity go farther?
\ip The \iqt astounding fact\iqt* is: that, out of the hundreds of languages which are, and have been, spoken on the earth, not one, except the Hebrew, is supposed to have the Waw Conversive; while, out of the hundreds of volumes which have been published in the Hebrew language, not one, except the Old Testament, has the Waw Conversive!

\im \k Samaritan.\k**  NICHOLLS writes: “Some verbs include, under the perfect form, both a perfect and present tense, ... we sometimes find a future circumstance related in the perfect tense, as something that has actually taken place, the design of the writers in this case was to mark the future occurrence as something already evidently decreed and decided on, and therefore as it were accomplished: thus Ge. 15:18, ‘To thy sons have I given the land.’ “The peculiar use of Waw, called Waw Conversive among the Hebrews, is \iqt unknown\iqt* to the Samaritans, Chaldees, and Syrians.
\ip “The future tense, besides the force of a future, seems to have the force of a present; as Ge. 37:15, ‘What seekest thou?’ Ex. 5:15, ‘Why do ye do so?’”—\iqt Grammar\iqt*, p. 93, 94.

\im \k Amharic.\k**  ISENBERG writes: “The Abyssinians have not, strictly speaking, more than two divisions of time, i.e., the past and the present; the present being used also for the future.... The present, which might be perhaps with propriety called aorist [?] because it is applicable to the future, as well as to the present tense, is a form composed of the contingent and the auxiliary.
\ip “Whether this form, when it occurs, is intended for the present or the future, generally depends on the context. In order, however, to have no doubt when they speak of future things, they use the simple contingent form with additional particles, ‘I have [am] to be honorable; time is for me [to come] that I am to be honorable.’
\ip “The simple preterite of the indicative is used ... for the present or immediate future. ... ‘I am gone,’ i.e., if you allow me I go now; or when a person is frequently called, and does not come, he at last answers, [I have come, I have come, i.e.] ‘I come, I come.’
\ip “The present indicative is used for both the present and the future tenses.
\ip “The future time is \iqt generally\iqt* expressed by the same forms which serve for the present, except the aoristic construction. In page 66 of this work we pointed out a decidedly future form, besides which they make use of the contingent with \iqt al\iqt* and \iqt dohonal\iqt*; but these two latter forms are not confined to the future; they are also used for the present tense.”

\im \k Ancient Arabic.\k**  RICHARDSON writes: “The \iqt preterite\iqt* is used also in place of the \iqt future\iqt*, and other tenses, which an attention to the construction only can render familiar. “The particle \iqt la\iqt*, ‘not,’ gives to the \iqt preterite\iqt* the signification of the \iqt present\iqt*, ‘the fruit of timidity does not gain [hath not gained], and doth not lose [hath not lost]. ... Perceded by \iqt az\iqt*, or \iqt aza\iqt*, ‘when,’ it becomes the \iqt future\iqt* of the subjunctive, ‘when you shall be [have been] among strange people, to whom you do not belong, then eat whatever is set before you, whether it be bad or good.’
\ip “The \iqt future\iqt* corresponds more frequently to our present than to any other tense, as may be remarked in almost every passage. ... It is frequently \iqt restrained\iqt* to a \iqt future\iqt* tense when the particle \iqt sa\iqt* is prefixed ... the negative \iqt lana\iqt*, ‘not at all,’ together with the particles \iqt saufa, saf, saw, say\iqt*, give it likewise the future sense. When preceded by \iqt ma\iqt*, ‘not,’ it has for the most part a present signification. ... \iqt lam\iqt* and \iqt lama\iqt*, ‘not yet,’ gives it, according to Erpenius, the sense of the \iqt preterite\iqt*.”—\iqt Grammar\iqt*, p. 81–89
\b
\im \k Modern Arabic.\k**  FARIS EL-SHIDIAC writes: “The form for the \iqt future\iqt* of the verb is also applicable for the \iqt present\iqt*. The modern Arabs, therefore, make it a real \iqt present\iqt* by joining it to some other word. Thus \iqt howa yaktuba\iqt*, signifies \iqt he writes\iqt*, or \iqt he will write\iqt*. But \iqt howa ammal yaktuba\iqt*, has the single signification of \iqt he is writing\iqt*. “Although in the classical Arabic there are two particles, \iqt sa\iqt* and \iqt saufa\iqt* employed to confine the verb to the future, they are very seldom used in ordinary books.”—\iqt Grammar\iqt*, p. 38.

\im \k Modern Syriac.\k**  STODDART writes.—“\iqt Present tense\iqt*. This is sometimes used ... as a \iqt future\iqt*, ‘we are going after a month;’ so in Ge. 6:17, where in the modern language we have the \iqt present\iqt* tense, and in the ancient the active participle. “\iqt Preterite tense\iqt*.—1) Used as a \iqt present\iqt*: e.g., a man in distress says; ‘\iqt I died\iqt*, i.e., I am dead; \iqt I choked\iqt*, i.e., I am choked, or I am drowned.’ A boy in recitation, if confused, will say ‘\iqt it lost on me\iqt*,’ i.e., I have lost it. Ask a man how his business is today, and he may reply, ‘It remained [remains] just so.’ Persons coming to make a petition will tell us, ‘we poured (i.e., we now place) our hope on you.’ Compare Ancient Syriac, (Hoff. P 129, 4.b.c.) (Compare also Ps. 1:1, in the Ancient and Modern.
\ip “4) As a \iqt future\iqt*, e.g., if you died tomorrow, you perished; if you believe, Christ just now (i.e., at this moment) received [will receive] you;' this is no doubt an emphatic future. Compare Nordh. P 966. 1,c.
\ip “5) As a \iqt subjunctive present\iqt*. ... Many of the idioms mentioned above give force and vivacity to the language. We are thus allowed to speak of events and actions which are present or future, though definite, or future and contingent, as if they had actually transpired and were recorded in the past. On this account the preterite is often used in Hebrew in the language of prophecy.
\ip “It is not strange that these different idioms lead to ambiguity, which no acquaintance with the language will fully remove; e.g., [a certain given phrase] may be translated, ‘our sweet voices let us all raise; \iqt or\iqt* we do all raise, \iqt or\iqt* we will all raise.’ The perplexity thus caused, however, is as nothing compared with the puzzling expressions we often find in Hebrew.”—\iqt Grammar\iqt*, p. 158–164.

\ip Similarly, in recounting a conversation, the Persians always make use of a dramatic style, i.e., they report the very words, as, Hattim told her that he would not eat—lit., Hattim said to her thus, I will not eat.”—\iqt Grammar\iqt*, p. 79.

\ip “It is to be observed, that in the \iqt subjunctive\iqt* mood ... the verb itself in the \iqt present\iqt*, and the auxiliary both of the \iqt present\iqt* and \iqt past-imperfect\iqt* tenses often carry with them somewhat of a \iqt future\iqt* sense; as, ‘If he come tomorrow, I may speak to him; if he should \iqt or\iqt* would come tomorrow, I might, could, would, or should speak to him.’
\ip “Observe also, that the auxiliaries \iqt should\iqt* and \iqt would\iqt*, in the \iqt imperfect\iqt* tenses, are used to express the \iqt present\iqt* and \iqt future\iqt* as well as the \iqt past\iqt*: as, ‘It is my desire, that he should, or would, come now, or tomorrow;’ as well as, ‘It was my desire, that he should or would come yesterday;’ so that, in this mood, the precise time of the verb is very much \iqt determined\iqt* by the nature and drift of the sentence.”—\iqt Grammar\iqt*, p. 116–119.

\im PICKBOURN writes: “The first of these English tenses, viz., \iqt I write\iqt*, is an aorist [?], or indefinite of the present time.
\ip “Even those compound participles, which denote \iqt completed\iqt* or \iqt finished\iqt* actions, may be applied to \iqt future\iqt*, as well as \iqt past\iqt* and \iqt present\iqt* time. Thus: “Whenever that ambitious young prince \iqt comes\iqt* to the throne, \iqt being supported\iqt* by a veteran army, and \iqt having got\iqt* possession of the treasures which will be [are] \iqt found\iqt* in his father’s coffers, he,” etc.—\iqt English Verb\iqt*, p. 111.

\im MARSH writes: “It is a curious fact that the \iqt Romance\iqt* languages, as well as the \iqt Romaic\iqt*, at one period of their history, all rejected the ancient inflected futures, and formed new compound or auxiliary ones, employing for that purpose the verbs \iqt will\iqt* and \iqt shall\iqt*, or \iqt have\iqt* in the sense of duty or necessity, though French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, have now agglutinated the infinite and auxiliary into a simple future.
\ip “Why is it that the Gothic languages have always possessed a \iqt past\iqt* tense, never a \iqt future\iqt*? Why did the Romance dialects retain the Latin \iqt past\iqt* forms, and reject the Latin \iqt future\iqt*?”
\ip “If the expression of time is an inherent necessity of the verb, special forms for the future as well as the present and the past ought to be universal, but in most modern European languages, the future is a compound, the elements of which are a \iqt present\iqt* auxiliary and an \iqt aorist\iqt* infinitive, for in the phrases I \iqt shall\iqt* go, he \iqt will\iqt* go, \iqt shall\iqt* and \iqt will\iqt* are in the present tense, and \iqt go\iqt* is aoristic.
\ip “The Anglo-Saxon, with a single exception in the case of a substantive verb, had absolutely no mode of expressing the future by any verbal form, simple or compound. The context alone determined the time, and in German, in the Scandinavian dialects, and in English, we still very commonly, as the Anglo-Saxons did, express the future by a present. \iqt Ich gehe morgen nach London\iqt*, I go, or I am going, to London tomorrow, are more frequently used by Germans and Englishmen, than \iqt ich werde gehen\iqt*, I shall or will go; and the adverbial nouns \iqt morgen\iqt* and tomorrow, not the verbs \iqt gehen\iqt* and go, are the true time-words.
\ip “The use of the present for the past, too, especially in spirited narrative and in poetry, is not less familiar, and in both these cases the expression of time belongs to the grammatical period, not to the verb.”—\iqt Lectures\iqt*, p. 204.
\imt7 Summary of the New View of the Hebrew Verb.
\im From these pages the scholar can scarcely fail to infer that:
\ili0 \k 1.\k** The form of the Hebrew verb \iqt yiqtol\iqt*, denotes a \iqt real present\iqt*, and not a \iqt future\iqt*:
\ili0 Because it is admitted by Ewald, Gesenius, Lee, Rodiger, and every other Hebrew Grammarian of name, that it is so in numberless places, and because there are thousands of instances where the Common English Version, and all other versions, ancient and modern, do rightly translate it as a \iqt present\iqt*.
\ili0 Because there are numerous passages where it cannot possibly be a \iqt future\iqt*; and as it is impossible, in the very nature of things, for a \iqt real future\iqt* to express \iqt present\iqt* time,—whereas it is very common, in almost all languages, rhetorically to express futurity by a present—it must be a present, and not a future.
\ili0 Because in all the Cognate Semitic Dialects it is regarded as a present.
\ili0 \k 2.\k** The form of the Hebrew verb \iqt qatal\iqt* denotes a \iqt past\iqt* (perfect or imperfect). It is also used idiomatically:
\ili0 To express a gentle \iqt imperative\iqt*; this is universally agreed by all Hebrew Grammarians to be the case when it is preceded by a regular imperative, e.g., “Speak and say,” lit., Speak, and thou hast said; but this limitation of theirs arises from imperfect acquaintance with the facts of the case, as there are many passages where there is no imperative preceding, yet where the past tense is used to express a command, e.g., Zech. 1:3, “And thou hast said,” i.e, “Say thou.” This idiom is also admitted to be common in all the Cognate Semitic Dialects.
\ili0 To express a fixed determination that a certain thing must and shall be. This idiom is distinctly admitted by the above-mentioned Hebrew Grammarians, and is common, not only in the Cognate Semitic Dialects, but in the \iqt Greek New Testament\iqt*, and also in the \iqt Greek\iqt* and \iqt Latin Classics\iqt*, as shown by Stuart, Winer, Macknight, Kuhner, and others.
\ili0 \k 3.\k** The \iqt Waw Conversive\iqt* is unnecessary. It is based upon superficial data, for:
\ili0 It supposes \iqt yiqtol\iqt* to be an \iqt exclusively future\iqt* form, which is not the case.
\ili0 It ignores the idiomatic use of the past tense to express a “fixed determination,” which is admitted by all Hebrew Grammarians.
\ili0 It casts the utmost uncertainty over the language, as, on the very same principles by which \iqt waw\iqt* is supposed to be conversive, the particles \iqt once, behind, not, yea, when, how? also, lo, because, so, except, why? therefore, whence? what?\iqt* and \iqt who?\iqt* must be held to be conversive likewise—which no sane man will venture to maintain.
\ili0 It does not explain all the phenomena of the case, for there are numberless passages “where a past tense is preceded neither by a future nor by an imperative (as the rules of Waw Conversive imperatively require), yet, when it is converted in the Common English Version, and with as much propriety as in any of those instances which are supposed to be indisputable.”
\ili0 It is unparalleled among all the other languages of the world—ancient and modern, eastern and western.
\ili0 It is found in no other composition in the Hebrew Language; in all the most ancient, and valued, and voluminous Hebrew writings it is wanting;—the Talmudim, the Perushim, the Midrashim, have it not. If the Hebrew language ever had a \iqt Waw Conversive\iqt*, is it at all likely that it should \iqt suddenly, totally\iqt*, and \iqt unobservedly\iqt* drop out of existence?
\ili0 \iqt The result of the whole is\iqt*: That the \iqt Waw Conversive\iqt* does not exist in the Hebrew Bible, and is Unnecessary, Imperfect, and Unexampled in any language.
\ip It has only a \iqt traditional\iqt* existence, being the too hasty \iqt generalization\iqt* of some ancient grammarians, who observed that the Septuagint Translators had—with the freedom which characterizes their whole work both in style and sentiments—deemed the Hebrew idioms too \iqt colloquial\iqt* for the fastidious Greeks, and too \iqt simple\iqt* for the dignity of literary composition; and as all succeeding translators, without an exception, were under the spell of the sacred character of that Version, it is no wonder, though much to be regretted, that their example was followed. Of late years there has been a very strong tendency in translators and expositors to adhere more than ever to the exact form of the Hebrew and Greek Tenses, but the present Translation is the first and only one in which it is carried out systematically.
\imt7 Confused Renderings of King James' Revisers.
\ip The English verb ‘destroy’ is, in the Common Version, the representative of not less than forty-nine different Hebrew words (as may be seen in the ‘Englishman’s Hebrew Concordance,’ p. 1510 of second edition);—the verb ‘to set,’ of forty, and ‘to bring,’ of thirty-nine, etc. It is evident, therefore, that the use of ‘Cruden’s Concordance,’ and all others based on the Common Version, can only mislead the mere English reader.
\ip The following list of words, with the number of their Hebrew representatives (according to the Common Version) expressed in numerals, will surprise all who have not hitherto attended to this subject; viz:
