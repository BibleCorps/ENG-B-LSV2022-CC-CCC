\v 1 Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
\v 2 For knowing wisdom and instruction, \qac ǁ\qac* For understanding sayings of intelligence,
\v 3 For receiving the instruction of wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* Righteousness, judgment, and uprightness,
\v 4 For giving to simple ones—prudence, \qac ǁ\qac* To a youth—knowledge and discretion.
\v 5 (The wise hear and increase learning, \qac ǁ\qac* And the intelligent obtain counsels.)
\v 6 For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, \qac ǁ\qac* Words of the wise and their acute sayings.
\v 7 Fear of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is the] beginning of knowledge, \qac ǁ\qac* Fools have despised wisdom and instruction!
\v 8 Hear, my son, the instruction of your father, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not leave the law of your mother,
\v 9 For they [are] a graceful wreath to your head, \qac ǁ\qac* And chains to your neck.
\v 10 My son, if sinners entice you, do not be willing.
\v 11 If they say, “Come with us, we lay wait for blood, \qac ǁ\qac* We watch secretly for the innocent without cause,
\v 12 We swallow them as Sheol—alive, \qac ǁ\qac* And whole—as those going down [to] the pit,
\v 13 We find every precious substance, \qac ǁ\qac* We fill our houses [with] spoil,
\v 14 You cast your lot among us, \qac ǁ\qac* One purse is—to all of us.”
\v 15 My son! Do not go in the way with them, \qac ǁ\qac* Withhold your foot from their path,
\v 16 For their feet run to evil, \qac ǁ\qac* And they hurry to shed blood.
\v 17 Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any bird.
\v 18 And they lay wait for their own blood, \qac ǁ\qac* They watch secretly for their own lives.
\v 19 So [are] the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, \qac ǁ\qac* It takes the life of its owners.
\v 20 Wisdom cries aloud in an out-place, \qac ǁ\qac* She gives forth her voice in broad places,
\v 21 She calls at the head of the multitudes, \qac ǁ\qac* In the openings of the gates, \qac ǁ\qac* In the city she says her sayings:
\v 22 “Until when, you simple, do you love simplicity? And have scorners desired their scorning? And do fools hate knowledge?
\v 23 Turn back at my reproof, behold, \qac ǁ\qac* I pour forth my spirit to you, \qac ǁ\qac* I make known my words with you.
\v 24 Because I have called, and you refuse, \qac ǁ\qac* I stretched out my hand, and none is attending,
\v 25 And you slight all my counsel, \qac ǁ\qac* And you have not desired my reproof.
\v 26 I also laugh in your calamity, \qac ǁ\qac* I deride when your fear comes,
\v 27 When your fear comes as destruction, \qac ǁ\qac* And your calamity comes as a windstorm, \qac ǁ\qac* When adversity and distress come on you.
\v 28 Then they call me, and I do not answer, \qac ǁ\qac* They seek me earnestly, and do not find me.
\v 29 Because that they have hated knowledge, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not chosen the fear of \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 30 They have not consented to my counsel, \qac ǁ\qac* They have despised all my reproof,
\v 31 And they eat of the fruit of their way, \qac ǁ\qac* And they are filled from their own counsels.
\v 32 For the turning of the simple slays them, \qac ǁ\qac* And the security of the foolish destroys them.
\v 33 And whoever is listening to me dwells confidently, \qac ǁ\qac* And [is] quiet from fear of evil!”
\c 2
\p
\v 1 My son, if you accept my sayings, \qac ǁ\qac* And lay up my commands with you,
\v 2 To cause your ear to attend to wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* You incline your heart to understanding,
\v 3 For if you call for intelligence, \qac ǁ\qac* [And] give forth your voice for intelligence,
\v 4 If you seek her as silver, \qac ǁ\qac* And search for her as hid treasures,
\v 5 Then you understand the fear of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And you find the knowledge of God.
\v 6 For \nd Yhwh\nd* gives wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* Knowledge and understanding from His mouth.
\v 7 Even to lay up substance for the upright, \qac ǁ\qac* A shield for those walking uprightly.
\v 8 To keep the paths of judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* And He preserves the way of His saints.
\v 9 Then you understand righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And judgment, and uprightness—every good path.
\v 10 For wisdom comes into your heart, \qac ǁ\qac* And knowledge is pleasant to your soul,
\v 11 Thoughtfulness watches over you, \qac ǁ\qac* Understanding keeps you,
\v 12 To deliver you from an evil way, \qac ǁ\qac* From any speaking contrary things,
\v 13 Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, \qac ǁ\qac* To walk in ways of darkness,
\v 14 Who are rejoicing to do evil, \qac ǁ\qac* They delight in [the] contrariness of the wicked,
\v 15 Whose paths [are] crooked, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, they are perverted in their ways.
\v 16 To deliver you from the strange woman, \qac ǁ\qac* From the stranger who has made her sayings smooth,
\v 17 Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, \qac ǁ\qac* And has forgotten the covenant of her God.
\v 18 For her house has inclined to death, \qac ǁ\qac* And her paths to Rephaim.
\v 19 None going in to her return, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor do they reach the paths of life.
\v 20 That you go in the way of the good, \qac ǁ\qac* And keep the paths of the righteous.
\v 21 For the upright inhabit the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And the perfect are left in it,
\v 22 And the wicked are cut off from the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And treacherous dealers plucked out of it!
\c 3
\p
\v 1 My son! Do not forget my law, \qac ǁ\qac* And let your heart keep my commands,
\v 2 For [the] length of [your] days and years, \qac ǁ\qac* Life and peace they add to you.
\v 3 Do not let kindness and truth forsake you, \qac ǁ\qac* Bind them on your neck, \qac ǁ\qac* Write them on the tablet of your heart,
\v 4 And find grace and good understanding \qac ǁ\qac* In the eyes of God and man.
\v 5 Trust to \nd Yhwh\nd* with all your heart, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not lean to your own understanding.
\v 6 In all your ways know Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And He makes your paths straight.
\v 7 Do not be wise in your own eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* Fear \nd Yhwh\nd*, and turn aside from evil.
\v 8 It is healing to your navel, \qac ǁ\qac* And moistening to your bones.
\v 9 Honor \nd Yhwh\nd* from your substance, \qac ǁ\qac* And from the beginning of all your increase;
\v 10 And your barns are filled [with] plenty, \qac ǁ\qac* And your presses break forth [with] new wine.
\v 11 Discipline of \nd Yhwh\nd*, my son, do not despise, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not be distressed with His reproof,
\v 12 For whom \nd Yhwh\nd* loves He reproves, \qac ǁ\qac* Even as a father the son He is pleased with.
\v 13 O the blessedness of a man [who] has found wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* And of a man [who] brings forth understanding.
\v 14 For better [is] her merchandise \qac ǁ\qac* Than the merchandise of silver, \qac ǁ\qac* And than gold—her increase.
\v 15 She [is] precious above rubies, \qac ǁ\qac* And all your pleasures are not comparable to her.
\v 16 Length of days [is] in her right hand, \qac ǁ\qac* In her left [are] wealth and honor.
\v 17 Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, \qac ǁ\qac* And all her paths [are] peace.
\v 18 She [is] a tree of life to those laying hold on her, \qac ǁ\qac* And whoever is retaining her [is] blessed.
\v 19 \nd Yhwh\nd* founded the earth by wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* He prepared the heavens by understanding.
\v 20 By His knowledge depths have been broken, \qac ǁ\qac* And clouds drop dew.
\v 21 My son! Do not let them turn from your eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* Keep wisdom and thoughtfulness,
\v 22 And they are life to your soul, and grace to your neck.
\v 23 Then you go your way confidently, \qac ǁ\qac* And your foot does not stumble.
\v 24 If you lie down, you are not afraid, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, you have lain down, \qac ǁ\qac* And your sleep has been sweet.
\v 25 Do not be afraid of sudden fear, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the desolation of the wicked when it comes.
\v 26 For \nd Yhwh\nd* is at your side, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has kept your foot from capture.
\v 27 Do not withhold good from its owners, \qac ǁ\qac* When your hand [is] toward God to do [it].
\v 28 Do not say to your friend, \qac ǁ\qac* “Go, and return, and tomorrow I give,” \qac ǁ\qac* When substance [is] with you.
\v 29 Do not devise evil against your neighbor, \qac ǁ\qac* And he sitting confidently with you.
\v 30 Do not strive with a man without cause, \qac ǁ\qac* If he has not done you evil.
\v 31 Do not be envious of a man of violence, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor fix on any of his ways.
\v 32 For the perverted [is] an abomination to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And His secret counsel [is] with the upright.
\v 33 The curse of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] in the house of the wicked. And He blesses the habitation of the righteous.
\v 34 If He scorns the scorners, \qac ǁ\qac* Yet He gives grace to the humble.
\v 35 The wise inherit glory, \qac ǁ\qac* And fools are bearing away shame!

\v 1 Hear, you sons, the instruction of a father, \qac ǁ\qac* And give attention to know understanding.
\v 2 For I have given to you good learning, do not forsake my law.
\v 3 For I have been a son to my father—tender, \qac ǁ\qac* And an only one before my mother.
\v 4 And he directs me, and he says to me: “Let your heart retain my words, \qac ǁ\qac* Keep my commands, and live.
\v 5 Get wisdom, get understanding, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not forget, nor turn away \qac ǁ\qac* From the sayings of my mouth.
\v 6 Do not forsake her, and she preserves you, \qac ǁ\qac* Love her, and she keeps you.
\v 7 The first thing [is] wisdom—get wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* And with all your getting get understanding.
\v 8 Exalt her and she lifts you up, \qac ǁ\qac* She honors you when you embrace her.
\v 9 She gives a wreath of grace to your head, \qac ǁ\qac* She gives you a crown of beauty freely.”
\v 10 Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, \qac ǁ\qac* And years of life [are] multiplied to you.
\v 11 I have directed you in a way of wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* I have caused you to tread in paths of uprightness.
\v 12 In your walking your step is not restricted, \qac ǁ\qac* And if you run, you do not stumble.
\v 13 Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, \qac ǁ\qac* Keep her, for she [is] your life.
\v 14 Do not enter into the path of the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not be blessed in a way of evildoers.
\v 15 Avoid it, do not pass over into it, \qac ǁ\qac* Turn aside from it, and pass on.
\v 16 For they do not sleep if they do no evil, \qac ǁ\qac* And their sleep has been taken away violently, \qac ǁ\qac* If they do not cause [some] to stumble.
\v 17 For they have eaten bread of wickedness, \qac ǁ\qac* And they drink wine of violence.
\v 18 And the path of the righteous [is] as a shining light, \qac ǁ\qac* Going and brightening until the day is established,
\v 19 The way of the wicked [is] as darkness, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not known at what they stumble.
\v 20 My son, give attention to my words, \qac ǁ\qac* Incline your ear to my sayings,
\v 21 Do not let them turn aside from your eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* Preserve them in the midst of your heart.
\v 22 For they [are] life to those finding them, \qac ǁ\qac* And healing to all their flesh.
\v 23 Above every charge keep your heart, \qac ǁ\qac* For out of it [are] the outgoings of life.
\v 24 Turn aside a contrary mouth from you, \qac ǁ\qac* And put perverse lips far from you,
\v 25 Your eyes look straightforward, \qac ǁ\qac* And your eyelids look straight before you.
\v 26 Ponder the path of your feet, \qac ǁ\qac* And all your ways [are] established.
\v 27 Do not incline [to] the right or to the left, \qac ǁ\qac* Turn aside your foot from evil!
\c 5
\p
\v 1 My son! Give attention to my wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* Incline your ear to my understanding,
\v 2 To observe thoughtfulness, \qac ǁ\qac* And your lips keep knowledge.
\v 3 For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, \qac ǁ\qac* And her mouth [is] smoother than oil,
\v 4 And her latter end [is] bitter as wormwood, \qac ǁ\qac* Sharp as a sword [with] mouths.
\v 5 Her feet are going down to death, \qac ǁ\qac* Her steps take hold of Sheol.
\v 6 The path of life—lest you ponder, \qac ǁ\qac* Her paths have moved—you do not know.
\v 7 And now, you sons, listen to me, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not turn from sayings of my mouth.
\v 8 Keep your way far from off her, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not come near to the opening of her house,
\v 9 Lest you give your splendor to others, \qac ǁ\qac* And your years to the fierce,
\v 10 Lest strangers be filled [with] your power, \qac ǁ\qac* And your labors in the house of a stranger,
\v 11 And you have howled in your latter end, \qac ǁ\qac* In the consumption of your flesh and your food,
\v 12 And have said, “How I have hated instruction, \qac ǁ\qac* And my heart has despised reproof,
\v 13 And I have not listened to the voice of my teachers, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not inclined my ear to my teachers.
\v 14 As a little thing I have been all evil, \qac ǁ\qac* In the midst of an assembly and a congregation.”
\v 15 Drink waters out of your own cistern, \qac ǁ\qac* Even flowing ones out of your own well.
\v 16 Let your fountains be scattered abroad, \qac ǁ\qac* In broad places streams of waters.
\v 17 Let them be to you for yourself, \qac ǁ\qac* And not to strangers with you.
\v 18 Let your fountain be blessed, \qac ǁ\qac* And rejoice because of the wife of your youth,
\v 19 A doe of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy you at all times, \qac ǁ\qac* Magnify yourself in her love continually.
\v 20 And why do you magnify yourself, \qac ǁ\qac* My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?
\v 21 For the ways of each are before the eyes of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And He is pondering all his paths.
\v 22 His own iniquities capture the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* And he is holden with the ropes of his sin.
\v 23 He dies without instruction, \qac ǁ\qac* And magnifies himself in the abundance of his folly!
\c 6
\p
\v 1 My son! If you have been guarantor for your friend, \qac ǁ\qac* Have struck your hand for a stranger,
\v 2 Have been snared with sayings of your mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* Have been captured with sayings of your mouth,
\v 3 Do this now, my son, and be delivered, \qac ǁ\qac* For you have come into the hand of your friend. Go, trample on yourself, and strengthen your friend,
\v 4 Do not give sleep to your eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* And slumber to your eyelids,
\v 5 Be delivered as a roe from the hand, \qac ǁ\qac* And as a bird from the hand of a fowler.
\v 6 Go to the ant, O slothful one, \qac ǁ\qac* See her ways and be wise;
\v 7 Which has no captain, overseer, and ruler,
\v 8 She prepares her bread in summer, \qac ǁ\qac* She has gathered her food in harvest.
\v 9 Until when, O slothful one, do you lie? When do you arise from your sleep?
\v 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, \qac ǁ\qac* A little clasping of the hands to rest,
\v 11 And your poverty has come as a traveler, \qac ǁ\qac* And your want as an armed man.
\v 12 A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* Walking [with] perverseness of mouth,
\v 13 Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, \qac ǁ\qac* Directing with his fingers,
\v 14 Contrariness [is] in his heart, devising evil at all times, \qac ǁ\qac* He sends forth contentions.
\v 15 Therefore his calamity comes suddenly, \qac ǁ\qac* He is broken instantly—and no healing.
\v 16 These six has \nd Yhwh\nd* hated, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, seven [are] abominations to His soul:
\v 17 High eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* False tongues, \qac ǁ\qac* And hands shedding innocent blood,
\v 18 A heart devising thoughts of vanity, \qac ǁ\qac* Feet hastening to run to evil,
\v 19 A false witness [who] breathes out lies, \qac ǁ\qac* And one sending forth contentions between brothers.
\v 20 Keep, my son, the command of your father, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not leave the law of your mother.
\v 21 Bind them on your heart continually, \qac ǁ\qac* Tie them on your neck.
\v 22 In your going up and down, it leads you, \qac ǁ\qac* In your lying down, it watches over you, \qac ǁ\qac* And you have awoken—it talks [with] you.
\v 23 For the command [is] a lamp, \qac ǁ\qac* And the Law a light, \qac ǁ\qac* And a way of life [are] reproofs of instruction,
\v 24 To preserve you from an evil woman, \qac ǁ\qac* From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
\v 25 Do not desire her beauty in your heart, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not let her take you with her eyelids.
\v 26 For a harlot consumes to a cake of bread, \qac ǁ\qac* And an adulteress hunts the precious soul.
\v 27 Does a man take fire into his bosom, \qac ǁ\qac* And are his garments not burned?
\v 28 Does a man walk on the hot coals, \qac ǁ\qac* And are his feet not scorched?
\v 29 So [is] he who has gone in to the wife of his neighbor, \qac ǁ\qac* None who touches her is innocent.
\v 30 They do not despise the thief, \qac ǁ\qac* When he steals to fill his soul when he is hungry,
\v 31 And being found he repays sevenfold, \qac ǁ\qac* He gives all the substance of his house.
\v 32 He who commits adultery [with] a woman lacks heart, \qac ǁ\qac* He who does it is destroying his soul.
\v 33 He finds a stroke and shame, \qac ǁ\qac* And his reproach is not wiped away,
\v 34 For jealousy [is] the fury of a man, \qac ǁ\qac* And he does not spare in a day of vengeance.
\v 35 He does not accept the appearance of any atonement, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, he does not consent, \qac ǁ\qac* Though you multiply bribes!
\c 7
\p
\v 1 My son! Keep my sayings, \qac ǁ\qac* And lay up my commands with you.
\v 2 Keep my commands, and live, \qac ǁ\qac* And my law as the pupil of your eye.
\v 3 Bind them on your fingers, \qac ǁ\qac* Write them on the tablet of your heart.
\v 4 Say to wisdom, “You [are] my sister.” And cry to understanding, “Relative!”
\v 5 To preserve you from a strange woman, \qac ǁ\qac* From a stranger who has made her sayings smooth.
\v 6 For at a window of my house, \qac ǁ\qac* I have looked out through my casement,
\v 7 And I see among the simple ones, \qac ǁ\qac* I discern among the sons, \qac ǁ\qac* A young man lacking understanding,
\v 8 Passing on in the street, near her corner, \qac ǁ\qac* And the way [to] her house he steps,
\v 9 In the twilight—in the evening of day, \qac ǁ\qac* In the darkness of night and blackness.
\v 10 And behold, a woman to meet him—(A harlot’s dress, and watchful of heart,
\v 11 She [is] noisy, and stubborn, her feet do not rest in her house.
\v 12 Now in an out-place, now in broad places, \qac ǁ\qac* And she lies in wait near every corner)—
\v 13 And she laid hold on him and kissed him, \qac ǁ\qac* She has hardened her face and says to him,
\v 14 “Sacrifices of peace-offerings [are] by me, \qac ǁ\qac* Today I have completed my vows.
\v 15 Therefore I have come forth to meet you, \qac ǁ\qac* To earnestly seek your face, and I find you.
\v 16 I decked my bed [with] ornamental coverings, \qac ǁ\qac* Carved works—cotton of Egypt.
\v 17 I sprinkled my bed [with] myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
\v 18 Come, we are filled [with] love until the morning, \qac ǁ\qac* We delight ourselves in loves.
\v 19 For the man is not in his house, \qac ǁ\qac* He has gone on a long journey.
\v 20 He has taken a bag of money in his hand, \qac ǁ\qac* At the day of the new moon he comes to his house.”
\v 21 She turns him aside with the abundance of her speech, \qac ǁ\qac* She forces him with the flattery of her lips.
\v 22 He is going after her straight away, he comes as an ox to the slaughter, \qac ǁ\qac* And as a chain to the discipline of a fool,
\v 23 Until an arrow splits his liver, \qac ǁ\qac* As a bird has hurried to a snare, \qac ǁ\qac* And has not known that it [is] for its life.
\v 24 And now, you sons, listen to me, \qac ǁ\qac* And give attention to sayings of my mouth.
\v 25 Do not let your heart turn to her ways, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not wander in her paths,
\v 26 For many [are] the wounded she caused to fall, \qac ǁ\qac* And mighty [are] all her slain ones.
\v 27 The ways of Sheol—her house, \qac ǁ\qac* Going down to inner chambers of death!
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Does wisdom not call? And understanding give forth her voice?
\v 2 At the head of high places by the way, \qac ǁ\qac* She has stood between the paths,
\v 3 At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, \qac ǁ\qac* The entrance of the openings, she cries aloud,
\v 4 “To you, O men, I call, \qac ǁ\qac* And my voice [is] to the sons of men.
\v 5 Understand, you simple ones, prudence, \qac ǁ\qac* And you fools, understand the heart,
\v 6 Listen, for I speak noble things, \qac ǁ\qac* And the opening of my lips [is] uprightness.
\v 7 For my mouth utters truth, \qac ǁ\qac* And wickedness [is] an abomination to my lips.
\v 8 All the sayings of my mouth [are] in righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* Nothing in them is contrary and perverse.
\v 9 All of them [are] plain to the intelligent, \qac ǁ\qac* And upright to those finding knowledge.
\v 10 Receive my instruction, and not silver, \qac ǁ\qac* And knowledge rather than choice gold.
\v 11 For wisdom [is] better than rubies, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, all delights are not comparable with it.
\v 12 I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, \qac ǁ\qac* And I find out a knowledge of purposes.
\v 13 The fear of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] to hate evil; Pride, and arrogance, and an evil way, \qac ǁ\qac* And a contrary mouth, I have hated.
\v 14 Counsel and substance [are] mine, \qac ǁ\qac* I [am] understanding, I have might.
\v 15 By me kings reign, and princes decree righteousness,
\v 16 By me chiefs rule, and nobles, \qac ǁ\qac* All judges of earth.
\v 17 I love those loving me, \qac ǁ\qac* And those seeking me earnestly find me.
\v 18 Wealth and honor [are] with me, \qac ǁ\qac* Lasting substance and righteousness.
\v 19 My fruit [is] better than gold, even fine gold, \qac ǁ\qac* And my increase than choice silver.
\v 20 I cause to walk in a path of righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* In midst of paths of judgment,
\v 21 To cause my lovers to inherit substance, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, I fill their treasures.
\v 22 \nd Yhwh\nd* possessed me—the beginning of His way, \qac ǁ\qac* Before His works since then.
\v 23 I was anointed from the age, from the first, \qac ǁ\qac* From former states of the earth.
\v 24 In there being no depths, I was brought forth, \qac ǁ\qac* In there being no fountains heavy [with] waters,
\v 25 Before mountains were sunk, \qac ǁ\qac* Before heights, I was brought forth.
\v 26 While He had not made the earth, and out-places, \qac ǁ\qac* And the top of the dusts of the world.

\v 33 The lot is cast into the center, \qac ǁ\qac* And all its judgment [is] from \nd Yhwh\nd*!
\c 17
\p

\v 16 Why [is] this—a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* And a heart—there is none?

\v 27 One acquainted with knowledge is sparing his words, \qac ǁ\qac* And the cool of temper [is] a man of understanding.
\v 28 Even a fool keeping silence is reckoned wise, \qac ǁ\qac* He who is shutting his lips [seems] intelligent!

\v 24 A man with friends—to show himself friendly, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is a lover adhering more than a brother!
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Better [is] the poor walking in his integrity, \qac ǁ\qac* Than the perverse [in] his lips—who [is] a fool.
\v 2 Also, without knowledge the soul [is] not good, \qac ǁ\qac* And the hasty in feet is sinning.
\v 3 The folly of man perverts his way, \qac ǁ\qac* And his heart is angry against \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 4 Wealth adds many friends, \qac ǁ\qac* And the poor is separated from his neighbor.
\v 5 A false witness is not acquitted, \qac ǁ\qac* Whoever breathes out lies is not delivered.
\v 6 Many beg the face of the noble, \qac ǁ\qac* And all have made friendship to a man of gifts.
\v 7 All the brothers of the poor have hated him, \qac ǁ\qac* Surely his friends have also been far from him, \qac ǁ\qac* He is pursuing words—they are not!
\v 8 Whoever is getting heart is loving his soul, \qac ǁ\qac* He is keeping understanding to find good.
\v 9 A false witness is not acquitted, \qac ǁ\qac* And whoever breathes out lies perishes.
\v 10 Luxury is not fitting for a fool, \qac ǁ\qac* Much less for a servant to rule among princes.
\v 11 The wisdom of a man has deferred his anger, \qac ǁ\qac* And his glory [is] to pass over transgression.

\v 16 Whoever is keeping the command is keeping his soul, \qac ǁ\qac* Whoever is despising His ways dies.
\v 17 Whoever is lending [to] \nd Yhwh\nd* is favoring the poor, \qac ǁ\qac* And He repays his deed to him.

\v 21 The purposes in a man’s heart [are] many, \qac ǁ\qac* And the counsel of \nd Yhwh\nd*—it stands.
\v 22 The desirableness of a man [is] his kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* And the poor [is] better than a liar.
\v 23 The fear of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] to life, \qac ǁ\qac* And he remains satisfied—he is not charged with evil.
\v 24 The slothful has hidden his hand in a dish, \qac ǁ\qac* Even to his mouth he does not bring it back.
\v 25 Strike a scorner, and the simple acts prudently, \qac ǁ\qac* And give reproof to the intelligent, \qac ǁ\qac* He understands knowledge.
\v 26 Whoever is spoiling a father causes a mother to flee, \qac ǁ\qac* A son causing shame, and bringing confusion.
\v 27 Cease, my son, to hear instruction—To err from sayings of knowledge.
\v 28 A worthless witness scorns judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* And the mouth of the wicked swallows iniquity.
\v 29 Judgments have been prepared for scorners, \qac ǁ\qac* And stripes for the back of fools!

\p
\v 1 Wine [is] a scorner—strong drink [is] noisy, \qac ǁ\qac* And any going astray in it is not wise.
\v 2 The fear of a king [is] a growl as of a young lion, \qac ǁ\qac* He who is causing him to be angry is wronging his soul.

\v 8 A king sitting on a throne of judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* Is scattering all evil with his eyes,
\v 9 Who says, “I have purified my heart, \qac ǁ\qac* I have been cleansed from my sin?”
\v 10 A stone and a stone, an ephah and an ephah, \qac ǁ\qac* Even both of them [are] an abomination to \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 11 Even by his actions a youth makes himself known, \qac ǁ\qac* Whether his work is pure or upright.
\v 12 A hearing ear, and a seeing eye—\nd Yhwh\nd* has even made both of them.
\v 13 Do not love sleep, lest you become poor, \qac ǁ\qac* Open your eyes—be satisfied [with] bread.

\v 17 The bread of falsehood [is] sweet to a man, \qac ǁ\qac* And afterward his mouth is filled [with] gravel.
\v 18 You establish purposes by counsel, \qac ǁ\qac* And with plans you make war.
\v 19 The busybody is a revealer of secret counsels, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not make yourself guarantor for a deceiver [with] his lips.
\v 20 Whoever is vilifying his father and his mother, his lamp is extinguished in blackness of darkness.
\v 21 An inheritance gotten wrongly at first, \qac ǁ\qac* Even its latter end is not blessed.
\v 22 Do not say, “I repay evil,” \qac ǁ\qac* Wait for \nd Yhwh\nd*, and He delivers you.
\v 23 A stone and a stone [are] an abomination to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And balances of deceit [are] not good.
\v 24 The steps of a man [are] from \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And man—how does he understand his way?
\v 25 A snare to a man [that] he has swallowed a holy thing, \qac ǁ\qac* And to make inquiry after vows.
\v 26 A wise king is scattering the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* And turns the wheel back on them.
\v 27 The breath of man [is] a lamp of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Searching all the inner parts of the heart.
\v 28 Kindness and truth keep a king, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has supported his throne by kindness.
\v 29 The beauty of young men is their strength, \qac ǁ\qac* And the honor of old men is grey hairs.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 The heart of a king [is] streams of waters in the hand of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* He inclines it wherever He pleases.
\v 2 Every way of a man [is] right in his own eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* And \nd Yhwh\nd* is pondering hearts.
\v 3 To do righteousness and judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* Is chosen of \nd Yhwh\nd* rather than sacrifice.
\v 4 Loftiness of eyes, and breadth of heart, \qac ǁ\qac* Tillage of the wicked [is] sin.
\v 5 The purposes of the diligent [are] only to advantage, \qac ǁ\qac* And of every hasty one, only to want.
\v 6 The making of treasures by a lying tongue, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] a vanity driven away of those seeking death.
\v 7 The spoil of the wicked catches them, \qac ǁ\qac* Because they have refused to do judgment.
\v 8 The way of a man who is vile [is] contrary, \qac ǁ\qac* And the pure—his work [is] upright.
\v 9 Better to sit on a corner of the roof, \qac ǁ\qac* Than [with] a woman of contentions and a house of company.

\v 15 To do justice [is] joy to the righteous, \qac ǁ\qac* But ruin to workers of iniquity.
\v 16 A man who is wandering from the way of understanding, \qac ǁ\qac* Rests in an assembly of Rephaim.
\v 17 Whoever [is] loving mirth [is] a poor man, \qac ǁ\qac* Whoever is loving wine and oil makes no wealth.
\v 18 The wicked [is] an atonement for the righteous, \qac ǁ\qac* And the treacherous dealer for the upright.
\v 19 Better to dwell in a wilderness land, \qac ǁ\qac* Than [with] a woman of contentions and anger.
\v 20 A treasure to be desired, and oil, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] in the habitation of the wise, \qac ǁ\qac* And a foolish man swallows it up.

\v 24 Proud, haughty, scorner—his name, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is working in the wrath of pride.
\v 25 The desire of the slothful slays him, \qac ǁ\qac* For his hands have refused to work.
\v 26 All the day desiring he has desired, \qac ǁ\qac* And the righteous gives and does not withhold.
\v 27 The sacrifice of the wicked [is] abomination, \qac ǁ\qac* Much more when he brings it in wickedness.
\v 28 A false witness perishes, \qac ǁ\qac* And an attentive man speaks forever.
\v 29 A wicked man has hardened by his face, \qac ǁ\qac* And the upright—he prepares his way.
\v 30 There is no wisdom, nor understanding, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor counsel against \nd Yhwh\nd*.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 A name is chosen rather than much wealth, \qac ǁ\qac* Than silver and than gold—good grace.

\v 24 The father of the righteous rejoices greatly, \qac ǁ\qac* The begetter of the wise rejoices in him.
\v 25 Your father and your mother rejoice, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, she bearing you is joyful.
\v 26 Give, my son, your heart to me, \qac ǁ\qac* And let your eyes watch my ways.
\v 27 For a harlot [is] a deep ditch, \qac ǁ\qac* And a strange woman [is] a narrow pit.
\v 28 She also, as catching prey, lies in wait, \qac ǁ\qac* And she increases the treacherous among men.
\v 29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaint? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?
\v 30 Those lingering by the wine, \qac ǁ\qac* Those going in to search out mixed wine.
\v 31 Do not see wine when it shows itself red, \qac ǁ\qac* When it gives its color in the cup, \qac ǁ\qac* It goes up and down through the upright.
\v 32 Its latter end—it bites as a serpent, \qac ǁ\qac* And it stings as a viper.
\v 33 Your eyes see strange women, \qac ǁ\qac* And your heart speaks perverse things.
\v 34 And you have been as one lying down in the heart of the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* And as one lying down on the top of a mast.
\v 35 “They struck me, I have not been sick, \qac ǁ\qac* They beat me, I have not known. When I awake—I seek it yet again!”
\c 24
\p
\v 1 Do not be envious of evil men, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not desire to be with them.
\v 2 For their heart meditates [on] destruction, \qac ǁ\qac* And their lips speak perverseness.
\v 3 A house is built by wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* And it establishes itself by understanding.
\v 4 And the inner parts are filled by knowledge, \qac ǁ\qac* [With] all precious and pleasant wealth.
\v 5 The wise [is] mighty in strength, \qac ǁ\qac* And a man of knowledge is strengthening power,
\v 6 For you make war for yourself by plans, \qac ǁ\qac* And deliverance [is] in a multitude of counselors.
\v 7 Wisdom [is] high for a fool, he does not open his mouth in the gate.
\v 8 Whoever is devising to do evil, \qac ǁ\qac* They call him a master of wicked thoughts.
\v 9 The thought of folly [is] sin, \qac ǁ\qac* And a scorner [is] an abomination to man.
\v 10 You have showed yourself weak in a day of adversity, \qac ǁ\qac* Your power is restricted,
\v 11 If [from] delivering those taken to death, \qac ǁ\qac* And you take back those slipping to the slaughter.
\v 12 When you say, “Behold, we did not know this.” Is the Ponderer of hearts not He who understands? And the Keeper of your soul He who knows? And He has rendered to man according to his work.
\v 13 My son, eat honey that [is] good, \qac ǁ\qac* And the honeycomb [is] sweet to your palate.
\v 14 So [is] the knowledge of wisdom to your soul, \qac ǁ\qac* If you have found that there is a posterity \qac ǁ\qac* And your hope is not cut off.
\v 15 Do not lay wait, O wicked one, \qac ǁ\qac* At the habitation of the righteous. Do not spoil his resting place.
\v 16 For the righteous fall and rise seven [times], \qac ǁ\qac* And the wicked stumble in evil.
\v 17 Do not rejoice in the falling of your enemy, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not let your heart be joyful in his stumbling,
\v 18 Lest \nd Yhwh\nd* see, and [it be] evil in His eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has turned His anger from off him.
\v 19 Do not fret yourself at evildoers, do not be envious at the wicked,
\v 20 For there is not a posterity to the evil, \qac ǁ\qac* The lamp of the wicked is extinguished.
\v 21 Fear \nd Yhwh\nd*, my son, and the king, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not mix yourself up with changers,
\v 22 For their calamity rises suddenly, \qac ǁ\qac* And the ruin of them both—who knows!
\v 23 These are also for the wise: [It] is not good to discern faces in judgment.
\v 24 Whoever is saying to the wicked, “You [are] righteous,” \qac ǁ\qac* Peoples execrate him—nations abhor him.
\v 25 And it is pleasant to those reproving, \qac ǁ\qac* And a good blessing comes on them.
\v 26 He who is returning straightforward words kisses lips.
\v 27 Prepare your work in an out-place, \qac ǁ\qac* And make it ready in the field—go afterward, \qac ǁ\qac* Then you have built your house.
\v 28 Do not be a witness against your neighbor for nothing, \qac ǁ\qac* Or you have enticed with your lips.
\v 29 Do not say, “As he did to me, so I do to him, \qac ǁ\qac* I render to each according to his work.”
\v 30 I passed by near the field of a slothful man, \qac ǁ\qac* And near the vineyard of a man lacking heart.
\v 31 And behold, it has gone up—all of it—thorns! Nettles have covered its face, \qac ǁ\qac* And its stone wall has been broken down.
\v 32 And I see—I set my heart, \qac ǁ\qac* I have seen—I have received instruction,
\v 33 A little sleep—a little slumber—A little folding of the hands to lie down.
\v 34 And your poverty has come [as] a traveler, \qac ǁ\qac* And your want as an armed man!
\c 25
\p
\v 1 These are also proverbs of Solomon, that men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed:
\v 2 The glory of God [is] to hide a thing, \qac ǁ\qac* And the glory of kings [is] to search out a matter.
\v 3 The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, \qac ǁ\qac* And the heart of kings—[are] unsearchable.
\v 4 Take away dross from silver, \qac ǁ\qac* And a vessel goes forth for the refiner,
\v 5 Take away the wicked before a king, \qac ǁ\qac* And his throne is established in righteousness.
\v 6 Do not honor yourself before a king, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not stand in the place of the great.
\v 7 For better [that] he has said to you, “Come up here,” \qac ǁ\qac* Than [that] he humbles you before a noble, \qac ǁ\qac* Whom your eyes have seen.
\v 8 Do not go forth to strive, hurry, turn, \qac ǁ\qac* What do you do in its latter end, \qac ǁ\qac* When your neighbor causes you to blush?
\v 9 Plead your cause with your neighbor, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not reveal the secret counsel of another,
\v 10 Lest the hearer put you to shame, \qac ǁ\qac* And your evil report not turn back.
\v 11 Apples of gold in imagery of silver, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] the word spoken at its fit times.
\v 12 A ring of gold, and an ornament of pure gold, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] the wise reprover to an attentive ear.
\v 13 As a vessel of snow in a day of harvest, \qac ǁ\qac* [So is] a faithful ambassador to those sending him, \qac ǁ\qac* And he refreshes the soul of his masters.
\v 14 Clouds and wind without rain, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] a man boasting himself in a false gift.
\v 15 A ruler is persuaded by long-suffering, \qac ǁ\qac* And a soft tongue breaks a bone.
\v 16 You have found honey—eat your sufficiency, \qac ǁ\qac* Lest you are satiated [with] it, and have vomited it.
\v 17 Withdraw your foot from your neighbor’s house, \qac ǁ\qac* Lest he is satiated [with] you, and has hated you.
\v 18 A maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] the man testifying a false testimony against his neighbor.
\v 19 A bad tooth, and a tottering foot, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] the confidence of the treacherous in a day of adversity.
\v 20 Whoever is taking away a garment in a cold day, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is as] vinegar on natron, \qac ǁ\qac* And a singer of songs on a sad heart.
\v 21 If he who is hating you hungers, cause him to eat bread, \qac ǁ\qac* And if he thirsts, cause him to drink water.
\v 22 For you are putting coals on his head, \qac ǁ\qac* And \nd Yhwh\nd* gives repayment to you.
\v 23 A north wind brings forth rain, \qac ǁ\qac* And a secret tongue—indignant faces.
\v 24 Better to sit on a corner of a roof, \qac ǁ\qac* Than [with] a woman of contentions, and a house of company.
\v 25 [As] cold waters for a weary soul, \qac ǁ\qac* So [is] a good report from a far country.
\v 26 A spring troubled, and a fountain corrupt, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] the righteous falling before the wicked.
\v 27 The eating of much honey is not good, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor a searching out of one’s own honor—honor.
\v 28 A city broken down without walls, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] a man without restraint over his spirit!
\c 26
\p
\v 1 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, \qac ǁ\qac* So honor [is] not fitting for a fool.
\v 2 As a bird by wandering, as a swallow by flying, \qac ǁ\qac* So reviling without cause does not come.
\v 3 A whip is for a horse, a bridle for a donkey, \qac ǁ\qac* And a rod for the back of fools.
\v 4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly, \qac ǁ\qac* Lest you are like to him—even you.
\v 5 Answer a fool according to his folly, \qac ǁ\qac* Lest he is wise in his own eyes.
\v 6 He is cutting off feet, he is drinking injury, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is sending things by the hand of a fool.
\v 7 The two legs of the lame have been weak, \qac ǁ\qac* And an allegory in the mouth of fools.
\v 8 As one who is binding a stone in a sling, \qac ǁ\qac* So [is] he who is giving honor to a fool.
\v 9 A thorn has gone up into the hand of a drunkard, \qac ǁ\qac* And an allegory in the mouth of fools.
\v 10 The Former of all [is] great, \qac ǁ\qac* And He is rewarding a fool, \qac ǁ\qac* And is rewarding transgressors.
\v 11 As a dog has returned to its vomit, \qac ǁ\qac* A fool is repeating his folly.
\v 12 You have seen a man wise in his own eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* More hope of a fool than of him!
\v 13 The slothful has said, \qac ǁ\qac* “A lion [is] in the way, \qac ǁ\qac* A lion [is] in the broad places.”
\v 14 The door turns around on its hinge, \qac ǁ\qac* And the slothful on his bed.
\v 15 The slothful has hid his hand in a dish, \qac ǁ\qac* He is weary of bringing it back to his mouth.
\v 16 Wiser [is] the slothful in his own eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* Than seven [men] returning a reason.
\v 17 Laying hold on the ears of a dog, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] a passer-by making himself wrath for strife [that is] not his own.
\v 18 As [one] pretending to be feeble, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is casting sparks, arrows, and death,
\v 19 So has a man deceived his neighbor, \qac ǁ\qac* And has said, “Am I not playing?”
\v 20 Fire is going out without wood, \qac ǁ\qac* And contention ceases without a tale-bearer,
\v 21 Coal to burning coals, and wood to fire, \qac ǁ\qac* And a man of contentions to kindle strife.
\v 22 The words of a tale-bearer [are] as self-inflicted wounds, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have gone down [to] the inner parts of the heart.
\v 23 Silver of dross spread over potsherd, \qac ǁ\qac* [Are] burning lips and an evil heart.
\v 24 A hater pretends by his lips, \qac ǁ\qac* And he places deceit in his heart,
\v 25 When his voice is gracious do not trust in him, \qac ǁ\qac* For seven abominations [are] in his heart.
\v 26 Hatred is covered by deceit, \qac ǁ\qac* Its wickedness is revealed in an assembly.
\v 27 Whoever is digging a pit falls into it, \qac ǁ\qac* And the roller of a stone, it turns to him.
\v 28 A lying tongue hates its bruised ones, \qac ǁ\qac* And a flattering mouth works an overthrow!
\c 27
\p
\v 1 Do not boast about tomorrow, \qac ǁ\qac* For you do not know what a day brings forth.
\v 2 Let another praise you, and not your own mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* A stranger, and not your own lips.
\v 3 A stone [is] heavy, and the sand [is] heavy, \qac ǁ\qac* And the anger of a fool \qac ǁ\qac* Is heavier than them both.
\v 4 Fury [is] fierce, and anger [is] overflowing, \qac ǁ\qac* And who stands before jealousy?
\v 5 Better [is] open reproof than hidden love.
\v 6 The wounds of a lover are faithful, \qac ǁ\qac* And the kisses of an enemy [are] abundant.
\v 7 A satiated soul treads down a honeycomb, \qac ǁ\qac* And every bitter thing [is] sweet [to] a hungry soul.
\v 8 As a bird wandering from her nest, \qac ǁ\qac* So [is] a man wandering from his place.
\v 9 Perfume and incense make the heart glad, \qac ǁ\qac* And the sweetness of one’s friend—from counsel of the soul.
\v 10 Do not forsake your own friend and the friend of your father, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not enter the house of your brother in a day of your calamity, \qac ǁ\qac* A near neighbor [is] better than a brother far off.
\v 11 Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, \qac ǁ\qac* And I return a word [to] my reproacher.
\v 12 The prudent has seen the evil, he is hidden, \qac ǁ\qac* The simple have passed on, they are punished.
\v 13 Take his garment when a stranger has been guarantor, \qac ǁ\qac* And pledge it for a strange woman.
\v 14 Whoever is greeting his friend with a loud voice, \qac ǁ\qac* Rising early in the morning, \qac ǁ\qac* It is reckoned a light thing to him.
\v 15 A continual dropping in a day of rain, \qac ǁ\qac* And a woman of contentions are alike,
\v 16 Whoever is hiding her has hidden the wind, \qac ǁ\qac* And the ointment of his right hand calls out.
\v 17 Iron is sharpened by iron, \qac ǁ\qac* And a man sharpens the face of his friend.
\v 18 The keeper of a fig tree eats its fruit, \qac ǁ\qac* And the preserver of his master is honored.
\v 19 As [in] water the face [is] to face, \qac ǁ\qac* So the heart of man to man.
\v 20 Sheol and destruction are not satisfied, \qac ǁ\qac* And the eyes of man are not satisfied.
\v 21 A refining pot [is] for silver, and a furnace for gold, \qac ǁ\qac* And a man according to his praise.
\v 22 If you beat the foolish in a mortar, \qac ǁ\qac* Among washed things—with a pestle, \qac ǁ\qac* His folly does not turn aside from off him.
\v 23 Know the face of your flock well, \qac ǁ\qac* Set your heart to the droves,
\v 24 For riches [are] not for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor a crown to generation and generation.
\v 25 The hay was revealed, and the tender grass seen, \qac ǁ\qac* And the herbs of mountains gathered.
\v 26 Lambs [are] for your clothing, \qac ǁ\qac* And the price of the field [are] male goats,
\v 27 And a sufficiency of goats’ milk [is] for your bread, \qac ǁ\qac* For bread to your house, and life to your girls!
\c 28
\p
\v 1 The wicked have fled and there is no pursuer, \qac ǁ\qac* And the righteous is confident as a young lion.
\v 2 By the transgression of a land its heads are many, \qac ǁ\qac* And by an understanding man, \qac ǁ\qac* Who knows right—it is prolonged.
\v 3 A man—poor and oppressing the weak, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] a sweeping rain, and there is no bread.
\v 4 Those forsaking the Law praise the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* Those keeping the Law plead against them.
\v 5 Evil men do not understand judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* And those seeking \nd Yhwh\nd* understand all.
\v 6 Better [is] the poor walking in his integrity, \qac ǁ\qac* Than the perverse of ways who is rich.
\v 7 Whoever is keeping the Law is an intelligent son, \qac ǁ\qac* And a friend of gluttons \qac ǁ\qac* Causes his father to blush.
\v 8 Whoever is multiplying his wealth by biting and usury, \qac ǁ\qac* Gathers it for one favoring the poor.
\v 9 Whoever is turning his ear from hearing the Law, \qac ǁ\qac* Even his prayer [is] an abomination.
\v 10 Whoever is causing the upright to err in an evil way, \qac ǁ\qac* He falls into his own pit, \qac ǁ\qac* And the perfect inherits good.
\v 11 A rich man is wise in his own eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* And the intelligent poor searches him.
\v 12 In the exulting of the righteous the glory [is] abundant, \qac ǁ\qac* And in the rising of the wicked man is apprehensive.
\v 13 Whoever is covering his transgressions does not prosper, \qac ǁ\qac* And he who is confessing and forsaking has mercy.
\v 14 O the blessedness of a man fearing continually, \qac ǁ\qac* And whoever is hardening his heart falls into evil.
\v 15 A growling lion, and a ranging bear, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] the wicked ruler over a poor people.
\v 16 A leader lacking understanding multiplies oppressions, \qac ǁ\qac* Whoever is hating dishonest gain prolongs days.
\v 17 A man oppressed with the blood of a soul, \qac ǁ\qac* Flees to the pit, [and] none takes hold on him [to help].
\v 18 Whoever is walking uprightly is saved, \qac ǁ\qac* And the perverted of ways falls at once.
\v 19 Whoever is tilling his ground is satisfied [with] bread, \qac ǁ\qac* And whoever is pursuing vanity, \qac ǁ\qac* Is filled [with] poverty.
\v 20 A steadfast man has multiplied blessings, \qac ǁ\qac* And whoever is hastening to be rich is not acquitted.
\v 21 [It] is not good to discern faces, \qac ǁ\qac* And a man transgresses for a piece of bread.
\v 22 The man [with] an evil eye [is] troubled for wealth, \qac ǁ\qac* And he does not know that want meets him.
\v 23 Whoever is reproving a man finds grace afterward, \qac ǁ\qac* More than a flatterer with the tongue.
\v 24 Whoever is robbing his father or his mother, \qac ǁ\qac* And is saying, “It is not transgression,” \qac ǁ\qac* He is a companion to a destroyer.
\v 25 Whoever is proud in soul stirs up contention, \qac ǁ\qac* And whoever is trusting on \nd Yhwh\nd* is made fat.
\v 26 Whoever is trusting in his heart is a fool, \qac ǁ\qac* And whoever is walking in wisdom is delivered.
\v 27 Whoever is giving to the poor has no lack, \qac ǁ\qac* And whoever is hiding his eyes multiplied curses.
\v 28 A man is hidden in the rising of the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* And the righteous multiply in their destruction!
\c 29
\p
\v 1 A man often reproved, hardening the neck, \qac ǁ\qac* Is suddenly broken, and there is no healing.
\v 2 In the multiplying of the righteous the people rejoice, \qac ǁ\qac* And in the ruling of the wicked the people sigh.
\v 3 A man loving wisdom makes his father glad, \qac ǁ\qac* And a friend of harlots destroys wealth.
\v 4 A king establishes a land by judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* And one receiving gifts throws it down.
\v 5 A man taking a portion above his neighbor, \qac ǁ\qac* Spreads a net for his own steps.
\v 6 A snare [is] in the transgression of the evil, \qac ǁ\qac* And the righteous sing and rejoice.
\v 7 The righteous knows the plea of the poor, \qac ǁ\qac* The wicked does not understand knowledge.
\v 8 Men of scorning ensnare a city, \qac ǁ\qac* And the wise turn back anger.
\v 9 A wise man is judged by the foolish man, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has been angry, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has laughed, and there is no rest.
\v 10 Men of blood hate the perfect, \qac ǁ\qac* And the upright seek his soul.
\v 11 A fool brings out all his mind, \qac ǁ\qac* And the wise restrains it until afterward.
\v 12 A ruler who is attending to lying words, \qac ǁ\qac* All his ministers [are] wicked.
\v 13 The poor and the man of frauds have met together, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* is enlightening the eyes of them both.
\v 14 A king that is judging the poor with truth, \qac ǁ\qac* His throne is established forever.
\v 15 A rod and reproof give wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* And a youth let away is shaming his mother.
\v 16 In the multiplying of the wicked transgression multiplies, \qac ǁ\qac* And the righteous look on their fall.
\v 17 Discipline your son, and he gives you comfort, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, he gives delights to your soul.
\v 18 A people is made naked without a vision, \qac ǁ\qac* And whoever is keeping the Law, O his blessedness!
\v 19 By words a servant is not instructed though he understand, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is nothing answering.
\v 20 You have seen a man hasty in his words! More hope of a fool than of him.
\v 21 Whoever is bringing up his servant delicately, from youth, \qac ǁ\qac* [At] his latter end he is also continuator.
\v 22 An angry man stirs up contention, \qac ǁ\qac* And a furious man is multiplying transgression.
\v 23 The pride of man humbles him, \qac ǁ\qac* And humility of spirit upholds honor.
\v 24 Whoever is sharing with a thief is hating his own soul, \qac ǁ\qac* He hears execration, and does not tell.
\v 25 Fear of man causes a snare, \qac ǁ\qac* And the confident in \nd Yhwh\nd* is set on high.
\v 26 Many are seeking the face of a ruler, \qac ǁ\qac* And the judgment of each [is] from \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 27 The perverse man [is] an abomination to the righteous, \qac ǁ\qac* And the upright in the way [is] an abomination to the wicked!
\c 30

\v 1 Words of Agur, son of Jakeh, the burden, a declaration of the man to Ithiel—to Ithiel and Ucal: I have wearied myself [for] God, \qac ǁ\qac* I have wearied myself [for] God, and am consumed.
\v 2 For I am more brutish than anyone, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not have the understanding of a man.
\v 3 Nor have I learned wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* Yet I know the knowledge of the Holy Ones.
\v 4 Who went up to the heavens, and comes down? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound waters in a garment? Who established all ends of the earth? What [is] His Name? And what [is] His Son’s Name? Surely you know!
\v 5 Every saying of God [is] tried, \qac ǁ\qac* He [is] a shield to those trusting in Him.
\v 6 Do not add to His words, lest He reason with you, \qac ǁ\qac* And you have been found false.
\v 7 Two things I have asked from You, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not withhold from me before I die.
\v 8 Put vanity and a lying word far from me, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not give poverty or wealth to me, \qac ǁ\qac* Cause me to eat the bread of my portion,
\v 9 Lest I become satiated, and have denied, \qac ǁ\qac* And have said, “Who [is] \nd Yhwh\nd*?” And lest I am poor, and have stolen, \qac ǁ\qac* And have laid hold of the Name of my God.
\v 10 Do not accuse a servant to his lord, \qac ǁ\qac* Lest he disapprove of you, and you are found guilty.
\v 11 A generation lightly esteems their father, \qac ǁ\qac* And does not bless their mother.
\v 12 A generation—pure in their own eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* But not washed from their own filth.
\v 13 A generation—how high are their eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, their eyelids are lifted up.
\v 14 A generation—their teeth [are] swords, \qac ǁ\qac* And their jaw-teeth [are] knives, \qac ǁ\qac* To consume the poor from earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And the needy from [among] men.
\v 15 To the leech [are] two daughters—Give! Give! Behold, three things are not satisfied, \qac ǁ\qac* Four have not said “Sufficiency”;
\v 16 Sheol, and a restrained womb, \qac ǁ\qac* Earth—it [is] not satisfied [with] water, \qac ǁ\qac* And fire—it has not said, “Sufficiency,”
\v 17 An eye that mocks at a father, \qac ǁ\qac* And despises to obey a mother, \qac ǁ\qac* Ravens of the valley dig it out, \qac ǁ\qac* And young eagles eat it.
\v 18 Three things have been too wonderful for me, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, four that I have not known:
\v 19 The way of the eagle in the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* The way of a serpent on a rock, \qac ǁ\qac* The way of a ship in the heart of the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* And the way of a man in youth.
\v 20 So—the way of an adulterous woman, \qac ǁ\qac* She has eaten and has wiped her mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* And has said, “I have not done iniquity.”
\v 21 For three things has earth been troubled, \qac ǁ\qac* And for four—it is not able to bear:
\v 22 For a servant when he reigns, \qac ǁ\qac* And a fool when he is satisfied with bread,
\v 23 For a hated one when she rules, \qac ǁ\qac* And a maidservant when she succeeds her mistress.
\v 24 Four [are] little ones of earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And they are made wiser than the wise:
\v 25 The ants [are] a people not strong, \qac ǁ\qac* And they prepare their food in summer,
\v 26 hyraxes [are] a people not strong, \qac ǁ\qac* And they place their house in a rock,
\v 27 There is no king to the locust, \qac ǁ\qac* And it goes out—each one shouting,
\v 28 A spider with two hands takes hold, \qac ǁ\qac* And is in the palaces of a king.
\v 29 There are three going well, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, four are good in going:
\v 30 An old lion—mighty among beasts, \qac ǁ\qac* That does not turn back from the face of any,
\v 31 A girt one of the loins, \qac ǁ\qac* Also a male goat, \qac ǁ\qac* And a king—troops with him.
\v 32 If you have been foolish in lifting yourself up, \qac ǁ\qac* And if you have devised evil—hand to mouth!
\v 33 For the churning of milk brings out butter, \qac ǁ\qac* And the wringing of the nose brings out blood, \qac ǁ\qac* And the forcing of anger brings out strife!

\v 1 Words of Lemuel, a king, a declaration that his mother taught him:
\v 2 “What, my son? And what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?
\v 3 Do not give your strength to women, \qac ǁ\qac* And your ways to wiping away of kings.
\v 4 [It is] not for kings, O Lemuel, \qac ǁ\qac* Not for kings, to drink wine, \qac ǁ\qac* And for princes—a desire of strong drink.
\v 5 Lest he drink, and forget the decree, \qac ǁ\qac* And change the judgment of any of the sons of affliction.
\v 6 Give strong drink to the perishing, \qac ǁ\qac* And wine to the bitter in soul,
\v 7 He drinks, and forgets his poverty, \qac ǁ\qac* And he does not remember his misery again.
\v 8 Open your mouth for the mute, \qac ǁ\qac* For the right of all sons of change.
\v 9 Open your mouth, judge righteously, \qac ǁ\qac* Both the cause of the poor and needy!”
\v 10 [ALEPH-BET] A woman of worth who finds? Indeed, her price [is] far above rubies.
\v 11 The heart of her husband has trusted in her, \qac ǁ\qac* And he does not lack spoil.
\v 12 She has done him good, and not evil, \qac ǁ\qac* All [the] days of her life.
\v 13 She has sought wool and flax, \qac ǁ\qac* And with delight she works [with] her hands.
\v 14 She has been as ships of the merchant, \qac ǁ\qac* She brings in her bread from afar.
\v 15 Indeed, she rises while yet night, \qac ǁ\qac* And gives food to her household, \qac ǁ\qac* And a portion to her girls.
\v 16 She has considered a field, and takes it, \qac ǁ\qac* She has planted a vineyard from the fruit of her hands.
\v 17 She has girded her loins with might, \qac ǁ\qac* And strengthens her arms.
\v 18 She has perceived when her merchandise [is] good, \qac ǁ\qac* Her lamp is not extinguished in the night.
\v 19 She has sent forth her hands on a spindle, \qac ǁ\qac* And her hands have held a distaff.
\v 20 She has spread forth her hand to the poor, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, she sent forth her hands to the needy.
\v 21 She is not afraid of her household from snow, \qac ǁ\qac* For all her household are clothed [with] scarlet.
\v 22 She has made ornamental coverings for herself, \qac ǁ\qac* Silk and purple [are] her clothing.
\v 23 Her husband is known in the gates, \qac ǁ\qac* In his sitting with [the] elderly of [the] land.
\v 24 She has made linen garments, and sells, \qac ǁ\qac* And she has given a girdle to the merchant.
\v 25 Strength and honor [are] her clothing, \qac ǁ\qac* And she rejoices at a latter day.
\v 26 She has opened her mouth in wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* And the law of kindness [is] on her tongue.
\v 27 She [is] watching the ways of her household, \qac ǁ\qac* And she does not eat bread of sloth.
\v 28 Her sons have risen up, and pronounce her blessed, \qac ǁ\qac* Her husband, and he praises her,
\v 29 “The daughters who have done worthily [are] many, \qac ǁ\qac* You have gone up above them all.”
\v 30 Favor [is] deceitful, and beauty [is] vain, \qac ǁ\qac* A woman fearing \nd Yhwh\nd*, she may boast herself.
\v 31 Give to her of the fruit of her hands, \qac ǁ\qac* And her works praise her in the gates!
