\p
\v 1 O the blessedness of that one, \qac ǁ\qac* Who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* And has not stood in the way of sinners, \qac ǁ\qac* And has not sat in the seat of scorners;
\v 2 But his delight [is] in the Law of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And in His law he meditates by day and by night:
\v 3 And he has been as a tree, \qac ǁ\qac* Planted by streams of water, \qac ǁ\qac* That gives its fruit in its season, \qac ǁ\qac* And its leaf does not wither, \qac ǁ\qac* And all that he does he causes to prosper.
\v 4 Not so the wicked: But [they are] as chaff that wind drives away!
\v 5 Therefore the wicked do not rise in judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous,
\v 6 For \nd Yhwh\nd* is knowing the way of the righteous, \qac ǁ\qac* And the way of the wicked is lost!
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Why have nations assembled tumultuously? And peoples meditate vanity?
\v 2 Kings of the earth station themselves, and princes have been united together, against \nd Yhwh\nd*, and against His Messiah:
\v 3 “Let us draw off Their cords, \qac ǁ\qac* And cast Their thick bands from us.”
\v 4 He who is sitting in the heavens laughs, \qac ǁ\qac* The Lord mocks at them.
\v 5 Then He speaks to them in His anger, and in His wrath He troubles them:
\v 6 “And I have anointed My King, \qac ǁ\qac* On Zion—My holy hill.”
\v 7 I declare concerning a statute: \nd Yhwh\nd* said to me, “You [are] My Son, today I have brought You forth.
\v 8 Ask of Me and I give nations [as] Your inheritance, \qac ǁ\qac* And the ends of the earth [for] Your possession.
\v 9 You rule them with a scepter of iron, \qac ǁ\qac* You crush them as a vessel of a potter.”
\v 10 And now, O kings, act wisely, \qac ǁ\qac* Be instructed, O judges of earth,
\v 11 Serve \nd Yhwh\nd* with fear, \qac ǁ\qac* And rejoice with trembling.
\v 12 Kiss the Chosen One \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* Son\bd ]]\bd*, lest He is angry, \qac ǁ\qac* And you perish [from] the way, \qac ǁ\qac* When His anger burns but a little, \qac ǁ\qac* O the blessedness of all trusting in Him!
\c 3
\d A Psalm of David, in his fleeing from the face of his son Absalom.
\p
\v 1 \nd Yhwh\nd*, how my distresses have multiplied! Many are rising up against me.
\v 2 Many are saying of my soul, “There is no salvation for him in God.” Selah.
\v 3 And You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, [are] a shield for me, \qac ǁ\qac* My glory, and lifter up of my head.
\v 4 My voice [is] to \nd Yhwh\nd*: I call and He answers me from His holy hill, Selah.
\v 5 I have lain down, and I sleep, \qac ǁ\qac* I have awoken, for \nd Yhwh\nd* sustains me.
\v 6 I am not afraid of myriads of people, \qac ǁ\qac* That they have set against me all around.
\v 7 Rise, O \nd Yhwh\nd*! Save me, my God! For You have struck all my enemies [on] the cheek. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.
\v 8 This salvation [is] of \nd Yhwh\nd*; Your blessing [is] on Your people! Selah.
\c 4
\d To the Overseer. with stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 In my calling answer me, \qac ǁ\qac* O God of my righteousness. In adversity You gave enlargement to me; Favor me, and hear my prayer.
\v 2 Sons of men! Until when [is] my glory for shame? You love a vain thing, you seek a lie. Selah.
\v 3 And know that \nd Yhwh\nd* \qac ǁ\qac* Has separated a saintly one to Himself. \nd Yhwh\nd* hears in my calling to Him.
\v 4 “Tremble, and do not sin”; Say [thus] in your heart on your bed, \qac ǁ\qac* And be silent. Selah.
\v 5 Sacrifice sacrifices of righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And trust in \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 6 Many are saying, “Who shows us good?” Lift on us the light of Your face, O \nd Yhwh\nd*,
\v 7 You have given joy in my heart, \qac ǁ\qac* From the time their grain and their wine \qac ǁ\qac* Have been multiplied.
\v 8 Together I lie down and sleep in peace, \qac ǁ\qac* For You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, alone, \qac ǁ\qac* Cause me to dwell in confidence!
\c 5
\d To the Overseer. [Blown] into the pipes. A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 Hear my sayings, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Consider my meditation.
\v 2 Be attentive to the voice of my cry, \qac ǁ\qac* My King and my God, \qac ǁ\qac* For I pray to You habitually.
\v 3 \nd Yhwh\nd*, [in] the morning You hear my voice, \qac ǁ\qac* [In] the morning I set in array for You, \qac ǁ\qac* And I look out [expectantly].
\v 4 For You [are] not a God desiring wickedness, \qac ǁ\qac* Evil does not inhabit You.
\v 5 The boastful do not station themselves before Your eyes: You have hated all working iniquity.
\v 6 You destroy those speaking lies, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* detests a man of blood and deceit.
\v 7 And I, in the abundance of Your kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* I enter Your house, \qac ǁ\qac* I bow myself toward Your holy temple in Your fear.
\v 8 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, lead me in Your righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of those observing me, \qac ǁ\qac* Make Your way straight before me,
\v 9 For there is no stability in their mouth. Their heart [is] mischiefs, \qac ǁ\qac* Their throat [is] an open grave, \qac ǁ\qac* They make their tongue smooth.
\v 10 Declare them guilty, O God, \qac ǁ\qac* Let them fall from their own counsels, \qac ǁ\qac* In the abundance of their transgressions \qac ǁ\qac* Drive them away, \qac ǁ\qac* Because they have been rebellious against You.
\v 11 And all trusting in You rejoice, \qac ǁ\qac* They sing for all time, and You cover them over, \qac ǁ\qac* And those loving Your Name exult in You.
\v 12 For You bless the righteous, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Surrounding him with favor as a buckler!
\c 6
\d To the Overseer. With stringed instruments, on the eighth. A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, do not reprove me in Your anger, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor discipline me in Your fury.
\v 2 Favor me, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, for I [am] weak, \qac ǁ\qac* Heal me, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* For my bones have been troubled,
\v 3 And my soul has been troubled greatly, \qac ǁ\qac* And You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, until when?
\v 4 Turn back, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, draw out my soul, \qac ǁ\qac* Save me for Your kindness’ sake.
\v 5 For in death there is no memorial of You, \qac ǁ\qac* In Sheol, who gives thanks to You?
\v 6 I have been weary with my sighing, \qac ǁ\qac* I meditate [on] my bed through all the night, \qac ǁ\qac* I dissolve my couch with my tear.
\v 7 My eye is old from provocation, \qac ǁ\qac* It is old because of all my adversaries,
\v 8 Turn from me all you workers of iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* heard the voice of my weeping,
\v 9 \nd Yhwh\nd* has heard my supplication, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* receives my prayer.
\v 10 All my enemies are greatly ashamed and troubled, \qac ǁ\qac* They turn back—ashamed [in] a moment!
\c 7
\d A Shiggaion of David, that he sung to YHWH concerning the words of Cush, a Benjamite.
\p
\v 1 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, my God, in You I have trusted, \qac ǁ\qac* Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me.
\v 2 Lest he tear my soul as a lion, \qac ǁ\qac* Tearing, and there is no deliverer.
\v 3 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, my God, if I have done this, \qac ǁ\qac* If there is iniquity in my hands,
\v 4 If I have done my well-wisher evil, \qac ǁ\qac* And draw my adversary without cause,
\v 5 [Then] an enemy pursues my soul, and overtakes, \qac ǁ\qac* And treads down my life to the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And places my glory in the dust. Selah.
\v 6 Rise, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, in Your anger, \qac ǁ\qac* Be lifted up at the wrath of my adversaries, \qac ǁ\qac* And awake Yourself for me: You have commanded judgment.
\v 7 And a congregation of peoples surround You, \qac ǁ\qac* And over it turn back on high.
\v 8 \nd Yhwh\nd* judges the peoples; Judge me, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* According to my righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And according to my integrity [that is] on me.
\v 9 Please let the evil of the wicked be ended, \qac ǁ\qac* And establish the righteous, \qac ǁ\qac* And a trier of hearts and reins is the righteous God.
\v 10 My shield [is] on God, \qac ǁ\qac* Savior of the upright in heart!
\v 11 God [is] judging right, \qac ǁ\qac* And He is not angry at all times.
\v 12 If [one] does not turn, \qac ǁ\qac* He sharpens His sword, \qac ǁ\qac* He has bent His bow [and] He prepares it,
\v 13 Indeed, He has prepared for Himself \qac ǁ\qac* Instruments of death, \qac ǁ\qac* He makes His arrows for burning pursuers.
\v 14 Behold, he travails [with] iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has conceived perverseness, \qac ǁ\qac* And has brought forth falsehood.
\v 15 He has prepared a pit, and he digs it, \qac ǁ\qac* And he falls into a ditch he makes.
\v 16 His perverseness returns on his head, \qac ǁ\qac* And his violence comes down on his crown.
\v 17 I thank \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* According to His righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And I praise the Name of \nd Yhwh\nd* Most High!
\c 8
\d To the Overseer. On the gittith. A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 \nd Yhwh\nd*, our Lord, \qac ǁ\qac* How majestic [is] Your Name in all the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* Who have set Your splendor on the heavens!
\v 2 From the mouths of infants and sucklings \qac ǁ\qac* You have founded strength, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of Your adversaries, \qac ǁ\qac* To still an enemy and a self-avenger.
\v 3 For I see Your heavens, a work of Your fingers, \qac ǁ\qac* [The] moon and stars that You established.
\v 4 What [is] man that You remember him? The son of man that You inspect him?
\v 5 You make him a little lower than the gods \bd [[\bd*\it or\it* God\bd ]]\bd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And surround him with glory and majesty.
\v 6 You cause him to rule \qac ǁ\qac* Over the works of Your hands, \qac ǁ\qac* You have placed all under his feet.
\v 7 Sheep and oxen, all of them, \qac ǁ\qac* And also beasts of the field,
\v 8 Bird of the heavens, and fish of the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* Passing through the paths of the seas!
\v 9 \nd Yhwh\nd*, our Lord, \qac ǁ\qac* How majestic [is] Your Name in all the earth!
\c 9
\d To the Overseer. [Set] on “Death of the Son.” A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 I confess, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, with all my heart, \qac ǁ\qac* I recount all Your wonders,
\v 2 I rejoice and exult in You, \qac ǁ\qac* I praise Your Name, O Most High.
\v 3 In my enemies turning backward, \qac ǁ\qac* They stumble and perish from Your face.
\v 4 For You have done my judgment and my right. You have sat on a throne, \qac ǁ\qac* Judging [with] righteousness.
\v 5 You have rebuked nations, \qac ǁ\qac* You have destroyed the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* You have blotted out their name for all time and forever.
\v 6 The enemy—[your] destructions have been completed forever, \qac ǁ\qac* As for cities you have plucked up, \qac ǁ\qac* Their memorial has perished with them.
\v 7 And \nd Yhwh\nd* abides for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* He is preparing His throne for judgment.
\v 8 And He judges the world in righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* He judges the peoples in uprightness.
\v 9 And \nd Yhwh\nd* is a tower for the bruised, \qac ǁ\qac* A tower for times of adversity.
\v 10 They trust in You who know Your Name, \qac ǁ\qac* For You have not forsaken those seeking You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 11 Sing praise to \nd Yhwh\nd*, inhabiting Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* Declare His acts among the peoples,
\v 12 For He who is seeking for blood \qac ǁ\qac* Has remembered them, \qac ǁ\qac* He has not forgotten the cry of the afflicted.
\v 13 Favor me, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* See my affliction by those hating me, \qac ǁ\qac* You who lift me up from the gates of death,
\v 14 So that I recount all Your praise, \qac ǁ\qac* In the gates of the daughter of Zion. I rejoice on Your salvation.
\v 15 Nations have sunk in a pit they made, \qac ǁ\qac* Their foot has been captured in a net that they hid.
\v 16 \nd Yhwh\nd* has been known, \qac ǁ\qac* He has done judgment; By a work of his hands \qac ǁ\qac* The wicked has been snared. Meditation. Selah.
\v 17 The wicked turn back to Sheol, \qac ǁ\qac* All nations forgetting God.
\v 18 For the needy is not forgotten forever, \qac ǁ\qac* [Nor] the hope of the humble lost for all time.
\v 19 Rise, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, do not let man be strong, \qac ǁ\qac* Let nations be judged before Your face.
\v 20 Appoint them to fear, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Let nations know they [are] men! Selah.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Why, \nd Yhwh\nd*, do You stand at a distance? Do You hide in times of adversity?
\v 2 Through the pride of the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* Is the poor inflamed, \qac ǁ\qac* They are caught in schemes that they devised.
\v 3 Because the wicked has boasted \qac ǁ\qac* Of the desire of his soul, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has blessed a dishonest gainer, \qac ǁ\qac* He has despised \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 4 The wicked does not inquire according to the height of his face. “There is no God!” [are] all his schemes.
\v 5 His ways writhe at all times, \qac ǁ\qac* Your judgments [are] on high before him, \qac ǁ\qac* All his adversaries—he puffs at them.
\v 6 He has said in his heart, “I am not moved, \qac ǁ\qac* [And am] not in calamity to generation and generation.”
\v 7 His mouth is full of oaths, \qac ǁ\qac* And deceits, and fraud: Under his tongue [is] perverseness and iniquity,
\v 8 He sits in an ambush of the villages, \qac ǁ\qac* He slays the innocent in secret places. His eyes secretly watch for the afflicted,
\v 9 He lies in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert. He lies in wait to catch the poor, \qac ǁ\qac* He catches the poor, drawing him into his net.
\v 10 He is bruised—he bows down, \qac ǁ\qac* The afflicted has fallen by his mighty ones.
\v 11 He said in his heart, “God has forgotten, \qac ǁ\qac* He has hid His face, \qac ǁ\qac* He has never seen.”
\v 12 Arise, O \nd Yhwh\nd*! O God, lift up Your hand! Do not forget the humble.
\v 13 Why has the wicked despised God? He has said in his heart, “It is not required.”
\v 14 You have seen, \qac ǁ\qac* For You behold perverseness and anger; By giving into Your hand, \qac ǁ\qac* The afflicted leave [it] on You, \qac ǁ\qac* You have been a helper of the fatherless.
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked and the evil, \qac ǁ\qac* Seek out his wickedness, find none;
\v 16 \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] King for all time and forever, \qac ǁ\qac* The nations have perished out of His land!
\v 17 You have heard the desire of the humble, O \nd Yhwh\nd*. You prepare their heart; You cause Your ear to attend,
\v 18 To judge the fatherless and bruised: He adds no more to oppress—man of the earth!
\c 11
\d To the Overseer. By David.
\p
\v 1 In \nd Yhwh\nd* I trusted, how do you say to my soul, “They moved to your mountain [as] the bird?”
\v 2 For behold, the wicked bend a bow, \qac ǁ\qac* They have prepared their arrow on the string, \qac ǁ\qac* To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
\v 3 When the foundations are destroyed, \qac ǁ\qac* The righteous—what has he done?
\v 4 \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] in His holy temple: \nd Yhwh\nd*—His throne [is] in the heavens. His eyes see—His eyelids try the sons of men.
\v 5 \nd Yhwh\nd* tries the righteous. And the wicked and the lover of violence, \qac ǁ\qac* His soul has hated,
\v 6 He pours on the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone, \qac ǁ\qac* And a horrible wind [is] the portion of their cup.
\v 7 For \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] righteous, \qac ǁ\qac* He has loved righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* His countenance sees the upright!
\c 12
\d To the Overseer. On the eighth. A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 Save, \nd Yhwh\nd*, for the saintly has failed, \qac ǁ\qac* For the steadfast have ceased \qac ǁ\qac* From the sons of men:
\v 2 They each speak vanity with his neighbor, \qac ǁ\qac* Lip of flattery! With heart and heart they speak.
\v 3 \nd Yhwh\nd* cuts off all lips of flattery, \qac ǁ\qac* A tongue speaking great things,
\v 4 Who said, “By our tongue we do mightily: Our lips [are] our own; who [is] lord over us?”
\v 5 Because of the spoiling of the poor, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of the groaning of the needy, \qac ǁ\qac* Now I arise, says \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* I set in safety [him who] breathes for it.
\v 6 Sayings of \nd Yhwh\nd* [are] pure sayings—Silver tried in a furnace of earth, refined sevenfold.
\v 7 You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, preserve them, \qac ǁ\qac* You keep us from this generation for all time.
\v 8 The wicked walk around continually, \qac ǁ\qac* According as vileness is exalted by sons of men!
\c 13
\d To the Overseer. A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 Until when, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Do You forget me forever? Until when do You hide Your face from me?
\v 2 Until when do I set counsels in my soul, \qac ǁ\qac* [With] sorrow in my heart daily? Until when is my enemy exalted over me?
\v 3 Look attentively; Answer me, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, my God, \qac ǁ\qac* Enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep in death,
\v 4 Lest my enemy say, “I overcame him,” \qac ǁ\qac* My adversaries rejoice when I am moved.
\v 5 And I have trusted in Your kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* My heart rejoices in Your salvation.
\v 6 I sing to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* For He has conferred benefits on me!
\c 14
\d To the overseer. By David.
\p
\v 1 A fool has said in his heart, “There is no God”; They have done corruptly, \qac ǁ\qac* They have done abominable actions, \qac ǁ\qac* There is not a doer of good.
\v 2 \nd Yhwh\nd* has looked from the heavens on the sons of men, \qac ǁ\qac* To see if there is a wise one—seeking God.
\v 3 The whole have turned aside, \qac ǁ\qac* Together they have been filthy: There is not a doer of good, not even one.
\v 4 Have all working iniquity not known? Those consuming my people have eaten bread, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not called \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 5 They have feared a fear there, \qac ǁ\qac* For God [is] in the generation of the righteous.
\v 6 You cause the counsel of the poor to stink, \qac ǁ\qac* Because \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] his refuge.
\v 7 “Who gives the salvation of Israel from Zion?” When \nd Yhwh\nd* turns back \qac ǁ\qac* [To] a captivity of His people, \qac ǁ\qac* Jacob rejoices—Israel is glad!
\c 15
\d A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 \nd Yhwh\nd*, who sojourns in Your tent? Who dwells in Your holy hill?
\v 2 He who is walking uprightly, \qac ǁ\qac* And working righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And speaking truth in his heart.
\v 3 He has not slandered by his tongue, \qac ǁ\qac* He has not done evil to his friend; And he has not lifted up reproach \qac ǁ\qac* Against his neighbor.
\v 4 A rejected one [is] despised in his eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* And he honors those fearing \nd Yhwh\nd*. He has sworn to endure evil, and does not change;
\v 5 He has not given his silver in usury, \qac ǁ\qac* And has not taken a bribe against the innocent; Whoever is doing these is not moved for all time!
\c 16
\d A Miktam of David.
\p
\v 1 Preserve me, O God, for I trusted in You.
\v 2 You have said to \nd Yhwh\nd*, “You [are] my Lord”; My goodness [is] not above You;
\v 3 For the holy ones who [are] in the land, \qac ǁ\qac* And the honorable, all my delight [is] in them.
\v 4 Their griefs are multiplied, [who] have hurried backward; I do not pour out their drink-offerings of blood, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor do I take up their names on my lips.
\v 5 \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] the portion of my share, and of my cup, \qac ǁ\qac* You uphold my lot.
\v 6 Lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, a beautiful inheritance [is] for me.
\v 7 I bless \nd Yhwh\nd* who has counseled me; Also [in] the nights my reins instruct me.
\v 8 I placed \nd Yhwh\nd* before me continually, \qac ǁ\qac* Because [He is] at my right hand I am not moved.
\v 9 Therefore my heart has been glad, \qac ǁ\qac* And my glory rejoices, \qac ǁ\qac* Also my flesh dwells confidently:
\v 10 For You do not leave my soul to Sheol, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor give your Holy One to see corruption.
\v 11 You cause me to know the path of life; In Your presence [is] fullness of joys, \qac ǁ\qac* Pleasant things [are] by Your right hand forever!
\c 17
\d A Prayer of David.
\p
\v 1 Hear, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, righteousness, attend my cry, \qac ǁ\qac* Give ear [to] my prayer, without lips of deceit.
\v 2 My judgment goes out from before You; Your eyes see uprightly.
\v 3 You have proved my heart, \qac ǁ\qac* You have inspected by night, \qac ǁ\qac* You have tried me, You find nothing; My thoughts do not pass over my mouth.
\v 4 As for doings of man, \qac ǁ\qac* Through a word of Your lips I have observed \qac ǁ\qac* The paths of a destroyer;
\v 5 To uphold my goings in Your paths, \qac ǁ\qac* My steps have not slipped.
\v 6 I called You, for You answer me, \qac ǁ\qac* O God, incline Your ear to me, hear my speech.
\v 7 Separate Your kindness wonderfully, O Savior of the confiding, \qac ǁ\qac* By Your right hand, from withstanders.
\v 8 Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the eye; Hide me in the shadow of Your wings,
\v 9 From the face of the wicked who spoiled me, \qac ǁ\qac* [From] my enemies in soul who go around against me.
\v 10 They have closed up their fat, \qac ǁ\qac* Their mouths have spoken with pride:
\v 11 “Our steps have now surrounded [him]”; They set their eyes to turn aside in the land.
\v 12 His likeness as a lion desirous to tear, \qac ǁ\qac* As a young lion dwelling in secret places.
\v 13 Arise, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, go before his face, \qac ǁ\qac* Cause him to bend. Deliver my soul from the wicked, Your sword,
\v 14 From men, Your hand, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* From men of the world, their portion [is] in life, \qac ǁ\qac* And [with] Your hidden things You fill their belly, \qac ǁ\qac* They are satisfied [with] sons, \qac ǁ\qac* And have left their abundance to their sucklings.
\v 15 I—in righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* I see Your face; I am satisfied, in awaking, [with] Your form!
\c 18
\d To the Overseer. By a servant of YHWH, by David, who has spoken to YHWH the words of this song in the day YHWH delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul, and he says:
\p
\v 1 I love You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, my strength.
\v 2 \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] my rock, and my bulwark, \qac ǁ\qac* And my deliverer, \qac ǁ\qac* My God [is] my rock, \qac ǁ\qac* I trust in Him: My shield, and the horn of my salvation, \qac ǁ\qac* My high tower.
\v 3 I call on \nd Yhwh\nd*, the Praised One, \qac ǁ\qac* And I am saved from my enemies.
\v 4 Cords of death have surrounded me, \qac ǁ\qac* And streams of the worthless make me afraid.
\v 5 Cords of Sheol have surrounded me, \qac ǁ\qac* Snares of death have been before me.
\v 6 In my adversity I call \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And I cry to my God. He hears my voice from His temple, \qac ǁ\qac* And My cry comes into His ears before Him.
\v 7 And the earth shakes and trembles, \qac ǁ\qac* And foundations of hills are troubled, \qac ǁ\qac* And they shake—because He has wrath.
\v 8 Smoke has gone up from His nostrils, \qac ǁ\qac* And fire from His mouth consumes, \qac ǁ\qac* Coals have been kindled by it.
\v 9 And He inclines the heavens, and comes down, \qac ǁ\qac* And thick darkness [is] under His feet.
\v 10 And He rides on a cherub, and flies, \qac ǁ\qac* And He flies on wings of wind.
\v 11 He makes darkness His secret place, \qac ǁ\qac* Around Him His dwelling place, \qac ǁ\qac* Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
\v 12 From the brightness before Him His thick clouds have passed on, \qac ǁ\qac* Hail and coals of fire.
\v 13 And \nd Yhwh\nd* thunders in the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* And the Most High gives forth His voice, \qac ǁ\qac* Hail and coals of fire.
\v 14 And He sends His arrows and scatters them, \qac ǁ\qac* And much lightning, and crushes them.
\v 15 And the streams of waters are seen, \qac ǁ\qac* And foundations of the earth are revealed, \qac ǁ\qac* From Your rebuke, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* From the breath of the wind of Your anger.
\v 16 He sends from above—He takes me, \qac ǁ\qac* He draws me out of many waters.
\v 17 He delivers me from my strong enemy, \qac ǁ\qac* And from those hating me, \qac ǁ\qac* For they have been stronger than I.
\v 18 They go before me in a day of my calamity \qac ǁ\qac* And \nd Yhwh\nd* is for a support to me.
\v 19 And He brings me forth to a large place, \qac ǁ\qac* He draws me out, because He delighted in me.
\v 20 \nd Yhwh\nd* repays me \qac ǁ\qac* According to my righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* According to the cleanness of my hands, \qac ǁ\qac* He returns to me.
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not done wickedly against my God.
\v 22 For all His judgments [are] before me, \qac ǁ\qac* And I do not turn His statutes from me.
\v 23 And I am perfect with Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And I keep myself from my iniquity.
\v 24 And \nd Yhwh\nd* returns to me, \qac ǁ\qac* According to my righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* According to the cleanness of my hands, \qac ǁ\qac* Before His eyes.
\v 25 With the kind You show Yourself kind, \qac ǁ\qac* With a perfect man You show Yourself perfect.
\v 26 With the pure You show Yourself pure, \qac ǁ\qac* And with the perverse You show Yourself a wrestler,
\v 27 For You save a poor people, \qac ǁ\qac* And cause the eyes of the high to fall.
\v 28 For You light my lamp, \qac ǁ\qac* My God \nd Yhwh\nd* enlightens my darkness.
\v 29 For by You I run [against] a troop! And by my God I leap a wall.
\v 30 God—perfect [is] His way, \qac ǁ\qac* The saying of \nd Yhwh\nd* is tried, \qac ǁ\qac* He [is] a shield to all those trusting in Him.
\v 31 For who [is] God besides \nd Yhwh\nd*? And who [is] a rock except our God?
\v 32 God—who is girding me [with] strength, \qac ǁ\qac* And He makes my way perfect.
\v 33 Making my feet like does, \qac ǁ\qac* And on my high places causes me to stand.
\v 34 Teaching my hands for battle, \qac ǁ\qac* And a bow of bronze was brought down by my arms.
\v 35 And You give to me the shield of Your salvation, \qac ǁ\qac* And Your right hand supports me, \qac ǁ\qac* And Your lowliness makes me great.
\v 36 You enlarge my step under me, \qac ǁ\qac* And my ankles have not slipped.
\v 37 I pursue my enemies, and overtake them, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not turn back until they are consumed.
\v 38 I strike them, and they are not able to rise, \qac ǁ\qac* They fall under my feet,
\v 39 And You gird me [with] strength for battle, \qac ǁ\qac* You cause my withstanders to bow under me.
\v 40 As for my enemies—You have given to me the neck, \qac ǁ\qac* As for those hating me—I cut them off.
\v 41 They cry, and there is no savior, \qac ǁ\qac* On \nd Yhwh\nd*, and He does not answer them.
\v 42 And I beat them as dust before wind, \qac ǁ\qac* I empty them out as mire of the streets.
\v 43 You deliver me \qac ǁ\qac* From the strivings of the people, \qac ǁ\qac* You place me for a head of nations, \qac ǁ\qac* A people I have not known serve me.
\v 44 At the hearing of the ear they listen to me, \qac ǁ\qac* Sons of a stranger feign obedience to me,
\v 45 Sons of a stranger fade away, \qac ǁ\qac* And are slain out of their close places.
\v 46 \nd Yhwh\nd* lives—and blessed [is] my rock, \qac ǁ\qac* And exalted is the God of my salvation.
\v 47 God—who is giving vengeance to me, \qac ǁ\qac* And He subdues peoples under me,
\v 48 My deliverer from my enemies, \qac ǁ\qac* You raise me above my withstanders, \qac ǁ\qac* Deliver me from a man of violence.
\v 49 Therefore I confess You among nations, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And I sing praise to Your Name,
\v 50 Magnifying the salvation of His king, \qac ǁ\qac* And doing kindness to His anointed, \qac ǁ\qac* To David, and to his seed—for all time!

\d To the Overseer. A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 The heavens [are] recounting the glory of God, \qac ǁ\qac* And the expanse [is] declaring the work of His hands.
\v 2 Day to day utters speech, \qac ǁ\qac* And night to night shows knowledge.
\v 3 There is no speech, and there are no words. Their voice has not been heard.
\v 4 Their line has gone forth into all the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And their sayings to the end of the world, \qac ǁ\qac* In them He placed a tent for the sun,
\v 5 And he, as a bridegroom, goes out from his covering, \qac ǁ\qac* He rejoices as a mighty one \qac ǁ\qac* To run the path.
\v 6 From the end of the heavens [is] his going out, \qac ǁ\qac* And his revolution [is] to their ends, \qac ǁ\qac* And nothing is hid from his heat.
\v 7 The law of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] perfect, refreshing the soul, \qac ǁ\qac* The testimonies of \nd Yhwh\nd* [are] steadfast, \qac ǁ\qac* Making the simple wise,
\v 8 The precepts of \nd Yhwh\nd* [are] upright, \qac ǁ\qac* Rejoicing the heart, \qac ǁ\qac* The command of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] pure, enlightening the eyes,
\v 9 The fear of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] clean, standing for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* The judgments of \nd Yhwh\nd* [are] true, \qac ǁ\qac* They have been righteous—together.
\v 10 They are more desirable than gold, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, \qac ǁ\qac* Even liquid honey of the comb.
\v 11 Also—Your servant is warned by them, “In keeping them [is] a great reward.”
\v 12 [His] errors—who understands? Declare me innocent from hidden ones,
\v 13 Also—keep back Your servant from presumptuous ones, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not let them rule over me, \qac ǁ\qac* Then I am perfect, \qac ǁ\qac* And declared innocent of much transgression.
\v 14 Let the sayings of my mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* And the meditation of my heart, \qac ǁ\qac* Be for a pleasing thing before You, \qac ǁ\qac* O \nd Yhwh\nd*, my rock, and my redeemer!

\v 1 \nd Yhwh\nd* answers you, \qac ǁ\qac* In a day of adversity, \qac ǁ\qac* The Name of the God of Jacob sets you on high,
\v 2 He sends your help from the sanctuary, \qac ǁ\qac* And supports you from Zion,
\v 3 He remembers all your presents, \qac ǁ\qac* And reduces your burnt-offering to ashes. Selah.
\v 4 He gives to you according to your heart, \qac ǁ\qac* And fulfills all your counsel.
\v 5 We sing of Your salvation, \qac ǁ\qac* And in the Name of our God set up a banner. \nd Yhwh\nd* fulfills all your requests.
\v 6 Now I have known \qac ǁ\qac* That \nd Yhwh\nd* has saved His anointed, \qac ǁ\qac* He answers him from His holy heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* With the saving might of His right hand.
\v 7 Some of chariots, and some of horses, \qac ǁ\qac* And we of the Name of our God \nd Yhwh\nd* \qac ǁ\qac* Make mention.
\v 8 They have bowed and have fallen, \qac ǁ\qac* And we have risen and station ourselves upright.
\v 9 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, save the king, \qac ǁ\qac* He answers us in the day we call!
\c 21
\d To the Overseer. A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 \nd Yhwh\nd*, the king is joyful in Your strength, \qac ǁ\qac* How greatly he rejoices in Your salvation.
\v 2 You gave the desire of his heart to him, \qac ǁ\qac* And You have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.
\v 3 For You put blessings of goodness before him, \qac ǁ\qac* You set a crown of fine gold on his head.
\v 4 He has asked for life from You, \qac ǁ\qac* You have given length of days to him, \qac ǁ\qac* For all time and forever.
\v 5 Great [is] his glory in Your salvation, \qac ǁ\qac* You place splendor and majesty on him.
\v 6 For You make him blessings forever, \qac ǁ\qac* You cause him to rejoice with joy, \qac ǁ\qac* By Your countenance.
\v 7 For the king is trusting in \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And in the kindness of the Most High he is not moved.
\v 8 Your hand comes to all Your enemies, \qac ǁ\qac* Your right hand finds Your haters.
\v 9 You make them as a furnace of fire, \qac ǁ\qac* At the time of Your presence. \nd Yhwh\nd* swallows them in His anger, \qac ǁ\qac* And fire devours them.
\v 10 You destroy their fruit from earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And their seed from the sons of men.
\v 11 For they stretched out evil against You, \qac ǁ\qac* They devised a wicked scheme, they do not prevail,
\v 12 For You make them turn their back, \qac ǁ\qac* When You prepare Your strings against their faces.
\v 13 Be exalted, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, in Your strength, \qac ǁ\qac* We sing and we praise Your might!

\v 2 My God, I call by day, and You do not answer, \qac ǁ\qac* And by night, and am not silent.
\v 3 And You [are] holy, \qac ǁ\qac* Sitting—the Praise of Israel.
\v 4 In You our fathers trusted; They trusted, and You deliver them.
\v 5 To You they cried, and were delivered, \qac ǁ\qac* In You they trusted, and were not disappointed.
\v 6 And I [am] a worm, and no man, \qac ǁ\qac* A reproach of man, and despised of the people.
\v 7 All beholding Me mock at Me, \qac ǁ\qac* They make free with the lip—shake the head,
\v 8 “Roll to \nd Yhwh\nd*, He delivers Him, \qac ǁ\qac* He delivers Him, for He delighted in Him.”
\v 9 For You [are] He bringing Me forth from the womb, \qac ǁ\qac* Causing Me to trust, \qac ǁ\qac* On the breasts of My mother.
\v 10 On You I have been cast from the womb, \qac ǁ\qac* From the belly of My mother You [are] My God.
\v 11 Do not be far from Me, \qac ǁ\qac* For adversity is near, for there is no helper.
\v 12 Many bulls have surrounded Me, \qac ǁ\qac* Mighty ones of Bashan have surrounded Me,
\v 13 They have opened their mouth against Me, \qac ǁ\qac* A lion tearing and roaring.
\v 14 I have been poured out as waters, \qac ǁ\qac* And all my bones have separated themselves, \qac ǁ\qac* My heart has been like wax, \qac ǁ\qac* It is melted in the midst of My bowels.
\v 15 My power is dried up as an earthen vessel, \qac ǁ\qac* And My tongue is cleaving to My jaws.
\v 16 And You appoint Me to the dust of death, \qac ǁ\qac* For dogs have surrounded Me, \qac ǁ\qac* A company of evildoers has surrounded Me, \qac ǁ\qac* Piercing My hands and My feet.
\v 17 I count all My bones—they look expectingly, \qac ǁ\qac* They look on Me,
\v 18 They apportion My garments to themselves, \qac ǁ\qac* And they cause a lot to fall for My clothing.
\v 19 And You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, do not be far off, \qac ǁ\qac* O My strength, hurry to help Me.
\v 20 Deliver My soul from the sword, \qac ǁ\qac* My only one from the paw of a dog.
\v 21 Save Me from the mouth of a lion \qac ǁ\qac* And You have answered Me from the horns of the high places!
\v 22 I declare Your Name to My brothers, \qac ǁ\qac* In the midst of the assembly I praise You.
\v 23 You who fear \nd Yhwh\nd*, praise Him, \qac ǁ\qac* All the seed of Jacob, honor Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And be afraid of Him, all you seed of Israel.
\v 24 For He has not despised, nor detested, \qac ǁ\qac* The affliction of the afflicted, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor has He hidden His face from Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And in His crying to Him He hears.
\v 25 Of You My praise [is] in the great assembly. I complete My vows before His fearers.
\v 26 The humble eat and are satisfied, \qac ǁ\qac* Those seeking Him praise \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Your heart lives forever.
\v 27 Remember and return to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Do all the ends of the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And bow themselves before You, \qac ǁ\qac* Do all families of the nations,
\v 28 For to \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] the kingdom, \qac ǁ\qac* And He is ruling among nations.
\v 29 And the fat ones of earth have eaten, \qac ǁ\qac* And they bow themselves, \qac ǁ\qac* All going down to dust bow before Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And he [who] has not revived his soul.
\v 30 A seed serves Him, \qac ǁ\qac* It is declared of the Lord to the generation.

\v 4 Also—when I walk in a valley of death-shade, \qac ǁ\qac* I fear no evil, for You [are] with me, \qac ǁ\qac* Your rod and Your staff—they comfort me.
\v 5 You arrange a table before me, \qac ǁ\qac* In front of my adversaries, \qac ǁ\qac* You have anointed my head with oil, \qac ǁ\qac* My cup is full!
\v 6 Surely goodness and kindness pursue me \qac ǁ\qac* All the days of my life, \qac ǁ\qac* And my dwelling [is] in the house of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* For [the] length of [my] days!

\v 6 And now my head is lifted up, \qac ǁ\qac* Above my enemies—my surrounders, \qac ǁ\qac* And I sacrifice in His tent sacrifices of shouting, \qac ǁ\qac* I sing, indeed, I sing praise to \nd Yhwh\nd*.

\v 4 Give to them according to their acting, \qac ǁ\qac* And according to the evil of their doings. Give to them according to the work of their hands. Return their deed to them.
\v 5 For they do not attend to the doing of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And to the work of His hands. He throws them down, \qac ǁ\qac* And does not build them up.
\v 6 Blessed [is] \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* For He has heard the voice of my supplications.
\v 7 \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] my strength, and my shield, \qac ǁ\qac* In Him my heart trusted, and I have been helped. And my heart exults, \qac ǁ\qac* And I thank Him with my song.
\v 8 \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] strength to him, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, the strength of the salvation of His anointed [is] He.
\v 9 Save Your people, and bless Your inheritance, \qac ǁ\qac* And feed them, and carry them for all time!

\v 3 The voice of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] on the waters, \qac ǁ\qac* The God of glory has thundered, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] on many waters.
\v 4 The voice of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] with power, \qac ǁ\qac* The voice of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] with majesty,
\v 5 The voice of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] shattering cedars, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, \nd Yhwh\nd* shatters the cedars of Lebanon.
\v 6 And He causes them to skip as a calf, \qac ǁ\qac* Lebanon and Sirion as a son of Reems,
\v 7 The voice of \nd Yhwh\nd* is hewing fiery flames,
\v 8 The voice of \nd Yhwh\nd* pains a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* pains the wilderness of Kadesh.
\v 9 The voice of \nd Yhwh\nd* pains the oaks, \qac ǁ\qac* And makes bare the forests, \qac ǁ\qac* And in His temple everyone says, “Glory!”
\v 10 \nd Yhwh\nd* has sat on the flood, \qac ǁ\qac* And \nd Yhwh\nd* sits [as] king for all time,

\v 1 I exalt You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* For You have drawn me up, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not let my enemies rejoice over me.
\v 2 My God \nd Yhwh\nd*, I have cried to You, \qac ǁ\qac* And You heal me.
\v 3 \nd Yhwh\nd*, You have brought up my soul from Sheol, \qac ǁ\qac* You have kept me alive, \qac ǁ\qac* From going down [to] the pit.
\v 4 Sing praise to \nd Yhwh\nd*, you His saints, \qac ǁ\qac* And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness,
\v 5 For—a moment [is] in His anger, \qac ǁ\qac* Life [is] in His goodwill, \qac ǁ\qac* At evening remains weeping, and at morning singing.
\v 6 And I have said in my ease, “I am not moved for all time.
\v 7 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, in Your good pleasure, \qac ǁ\qac* You have caused strength to remain for my mountain,” \qac ǁ\qac* You have hidden Your face—I have been troubled.
\v 8 To You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, I call, \qac ǁ\qac* And to \nd Yhwh\nd* I make supplication.
\v 9 “What gain [is] in my blood? In my going down to corruption? Does dust thank You? Does it declare Your truth?
\v 10 Hear, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, and favor me, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, be a helper to me.”
\v 11 You have turned my mourning to dancing for me, \qac ǁ\qac* You have loosed my sackcloth, \qac ǁ\qac* And gird me [with] joy.
\v 12 So that glory praises You, and is not silent, \qac ǁ\qac* O \nd Yhwh\nd*, my God, I thank You for all time!

\v 2 Incline Your ear to me quickly, deliver me, \qac ǁ\qac* Be to me for a strong rock, \qac ǁ\qac* For a house of bulwarks to save me.
\v 3 For You [are] my rock and my bulwark, \qac ǁ\qac* For Your Name’s sake lead me and tend me.
\v 4 Bring me out from the net that they hid for me, \qac ǁ\qac* For You [are] my strength.
\v 5 Into Your hand I commit my spirit, \qac ǁ\qac* You have redeemed me, \nd Yhwh\nd* God of truth.
\v 6 I have hated the observers of lying vanities, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have been confident toward \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 7 I rejoice, and am glad in Your kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* In that You have seen my affliction, \qac ǁ\qac* You have known my soul in adversities.
\v 8 And You have not shut me up, \qac ǁ\qac* Into the hand of an enemy, \qac ǁ\qac* You have caused my feet to stand in a broad place.
\v 9 Favor me, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, for distress [is] to me, \qac ǁ\qac* My eye, my soul, and my body \qac ǁ\qac* Have become old by provocation.
\v 10 For my life has been consumed in sorrow \qac ǁ\qac* And my years in sighing. My strength has been feeble because of my iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* And my bones have become old.
\v 11 I have been a reproach among all my adversaries, \qac ǁ\qac* And to my neighbors exceedingly, \qac ǁ\qac* And a fear to my acquaintances, \qac ǁ\qac* Those seeing me without—fled from me.
\v 12 I have been forgotten as dead, out of mind, \qac ǁ\qac* I have been as a perishing vessel.
\v 13 For I have heard an evil account of many, \qac ǁ\qac* Fear [is] all around. In their being united against me, \qac ǁ\qac* They have devised to take my life,
\v 14 And I have trusted on You, \qac ǁ\qac* O \nd Yhwh\nd*, I have said, “You [are] my God.”
\v 15 In Your hand [are] my times, \qac ǁ\qac* Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, \qac ǁ\qac* And from my pursuers.
\v 16 Cause Your face to shine on Your servant, \qac ǁ\qac* Save me in Your kindness.
\v 17 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, do not let me be ashamed, \qac ǁ\qac* For I have called You, let the wicked be ashamed, \qac ǁ\qac* Let them become silent to Sheol.
\v 18 Let lips of falsehood become mute, \qac ǁ\qac* That are speaking against the righteous, \qac ǁ\qac* Ancient sayings, in pride and contempt.
\v 19 How abundant is Your goodness, \qac ǁ\qac* That You have laid up for those fearing You, \qac ǁ\qac* You have worked for those trusting in You, \qac ǁ\qac* Before sons of men.
\v 20 You hide them in the secret place of Your presence, \qac ǁ\qac* From schemes of man, \qac ǁ\qac* You conceal them in a dwelling place, \qac ǁ\qac* From the strife of tongues.
\v 21 Blessed [is] \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* For He has made His kindness marvelous \qac ǁ\qac* To me in a city of bulwarks.
\v 22 And I have said in my haste, “I have been cut off from before Your eyes,” \qac ǁ\qac* But You have heard the voice of my supplications, \qac ǁ\qac* In my crying to You.
\v 23 Love \nd Yhwh\nd*, all you His saints, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* is keeping the faithful, \qac ǁ\qac* And repaying a proud doer abundantly.
\v 24 Be strong, and He strengthens your heart, \qac ǁ\qac* All you who are waiting for \nd Yhwh\nd*!

\v 1 O the blessedness of him whose transgression [is] forgiven, \qac ǁ\qac* Whose sin is covered.
\v 2 O the blessedness of a man, \qac ǁ\qac* To whom \nd Yhwh\nd* does not impute iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* And in whose spirit there is no deceit.
\v 3 When I have kept silence, my bones have become old, \qac ǁ\qac* Through my roaring all the day.
\v 4 When by day and by night Your hand is heavy on me, \qac ǁ\qac* My moisture has been changed \qac ǁ\qac* Into the droughts of summer. Selah.
\v 5 I cause You to know my sin, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have not covered my iniquity. I have said, “I confess to \nd Yhwh\nd* concerning My transgressions,” \qac ǁ\qac* And You have taken away the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
\v 6 For every saintly one prays this to You, \qac ǁ\qac* In the time to find [You]. Surely at an overflowing of many waters, \qac ǁ\qac* They do not come to him.
\v 7 You [are] a hiding place for me, \qac ǁ\qac* You keep me from distress, \qac ǁ\qac* Surround me [with] songs of deliverance. Selah.
\v 8 I cause you to act wisely, \qac ǁ\qac* And direct you in the way that you go, \qac ǁ\qac* I cause My eye to take counsel concerning you.
\v 9 Do not be as a horse—as a mule, \qac ǁ\qac* Without understanding, \qac ǁ\qac* With bridle and bit, its ornaments, to curb, \qac ǁ\qac* Not to come near to you.
\v 10 Many [are] the pains of the wicked; As for him who is trusting in \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Kindness surrounds him.
\v 11 Be glad in \nd Yhwh\nd*, and rejoice, you righteous, \qac ǁ\qac* And sing, all you upright of heart!
\c 33
\p
\v 1 Sing, you righteous, in \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* [For] praise from upright ones [is] lovely.
\v 2 Give thanks to \nd Yhwh\nd* with a harp, \qac ǁ\qac* With stringed instrument of ten strings sing praise to Him,
\v 3 Sing to Him a new song, \qac ǁ\qac* Play skillfully with shouting.
\v 4 For the word of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] upright, \qac ǁ\qac* And all His work [is] in faithfulness.
\v 5 Loving righteousness and judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* The earth is full of the kindness of \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 6 By the word of \nd Yhwh\nd* \qac ǁ\qac* The heavens have been made, \qac ǁ\qac* And all their host by the breath of His mouth.
\v 7 Gathering the waters of the sea as a heap, \qac ǁ\qac* Putting the depths in treasuries.
\v 8 All the earth is afraid of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* All the inhabitants of the world are afraid of Him.
\v 9 For He has spoken, and it is, \qac ǁ\qac* He has commanded, and it stands.
\v 10 \nd Yhwh\nd* made void the counsel of nations, \qac ǁ\qac* He disallowed the thoughts of the peoples.
\v 11 The counsel of \nd Yhwh\nd* stands for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* The thoughts of His heart from generation to generation.
\v 12 O the blessedness of the nation whose God [is] \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Of the people He chose, \qac ǁ\qac* For an inheritance to Him.
\v 13 \nd Yhwh\nd* has looked from the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* He has seen all the sons of men.
\v 14 From the fixed place of His dwelling, \qac ǁ\qac* He looked to all inhabitants of the earth;
\v 15 Who is forming their hearts together, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is attending to all their works.
\v 16 The king is not saved by the multitude of a force. A mighty man is not delivered, \qac ǁ\qac* By abundance of power.
\v 17 A false thing [is] the horse for safety, \qac ǁ\qac* And he does not deliver \qac ǁ\qac* By the abundance of his strength.
\v 18 Behold, the eye of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] to those fearing Him, \qac ǁ\qac* To those waiting for His kindness,
\v 19 To deliver their soul from death, \qac ǁ\qac* And to keep them alive in famine.

\v 9 Fear \nd Yhwh\nd*, you His holy ones, \qac ǁ\qac* For there is no lack to those fearing Him.

\v 4 They are ashamed and blush, those seeking my soul, \qac ǁ\qac* Turned backward and confounded, \qac ǁ\qac* Those devising my evil.
\v 5 They are as chaff before wind, \qac ǁ\qac* And a messenger of \nd Yhwh\nd* driving away.
\v 6 Their way is darkness and slipperiness, \qac ǁ\qac* And a messenger of \nd Yhwh\nd*—their pursuer.
\v 7 For without cause they hid their net [in] a pit for me, \qac ǁ\qac* Without cause they dug for my soul.
\v 8 Desolation meets him—he does not know, \qac ǁ\qac* And his net that he hid catches him, \qac ǁ\qac* He falls into it for desolation.

\v 17 Lord, how long do You behold? Keep my soul back from their desolations, \qac ǁ\qac* My only one from young lions.
\v 18 I thank You in a great assembly, \qac ǁ\qac* I praise You among a mighty people.
\v 19 Do not let my enemies rejoice over me [with] falsehood, \qac ǁ\qac* Those hating me without cause wink the eye.
\v 20 For they do not speak peace, \qac ǁ\qac* And against the quiet of the land, \qac ǁ\qac* They devise deceitful words,
\v 21 And they enlarge their mouth against me, \qac ǁ\qac* They said, “Aha, aha, our eye has seen.”

\v 24 Judge me according to Your righteousness, O \nd Yhwh\nd* my God, \qac ǁ\qac* And they do not rejoice over me.
\v 25 They do not say in their heart, “Aha, our desire.” They do not say, “We swallowed him up.”
\v 26 They are ashamed and confounded together, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are rejoicing at my evil. They put on shame and confusion, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are magnifying themselves against me.
\v 27 They sing and rejoice, who are desiring my righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And they continually say, “\nd Yhwh\nd* is magnified, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is desiring the peace of His servant.”

\v 34 Look to \nd Yhwh\nd*, and keep His way, \qac ǁ\qac* And He exalts you to possess the land, \qac ǁ\qac* In the wicked being cut off—you see!
\v 35 I have seen the wicked terrible, \qac ǁ\qac* And spreading as a green native plant,
\v 36 And he passes away, and behold, he is not, \qac ǁ\qac* And I seek him, and he is not found!
\v 37 Observe the perfect, and see the upright, \qac ǁ\qac* For the latter end of each [is] peace.
\v 38 And transgressors were destroyed together, \qac ǁ\qac* The latter end of the wicked was cut off.
\v 39 And the salvation of the righteous [is] from \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Their strong place in a time of adversity.
\v 40 And \nd Yhwh\nd* helps them and delivers them, \qac ǁ\qac* He delivers them from the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* And saves them, \qac ǁ\qac* Because they trusted in Him!

\d A Psalm of David. “To Cause to Remember.”
\p
\v 1 \nd Yhwh\nd*, do not reprove me in Your wrath, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor discipline me in Your fury.
\v 2 For Your arrows have come down on me, \qac ǁ\qac* And You let down Your hand on me.
\v 3 Soundness is not in my flesh, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of Your indignation, \qac ǁ\qac* Peace is not in my bones, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of my sin.
\v 4 For my iniquities have passed over my head, \qac ǁ\qac* As a heavy burden—too heavy for me.
\v 5 Stunk—my wounds have become corrupt, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of my folly.
\v 6 I have been bent down, \qac ǁ\qac* I have been bowed down—to excess, \qac ǁ\qac* I have gone mourning all the day.
\v 7 For my flanks have been full of drought, \qac ǁ\qac* And soundness is not in my flesh.
\v 8 I have been feeble and struck—to excess, \qac ǁ\qac* I have roared from disquietude of heart.
\v 9 Lord, all my desire [is] before You, \qac ǁ\qac* And my sighing has not been hid from You.
\v 10 My heart [is] panting, my power has forsaken me, \qac ǁ\qac* And the light of my eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* Even they are not with me.
\v 11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from before my plague. And my neighbors have stood far off.
\v 12 And those seeking my soul lay a snare, \qac ǁ\qac* And those seeking my evil \qac ǁ\qac* Have spoken mischievous things, \qac ǁ\qac* And they meditate [on] deceits all the day.
\v 13 And I, as deaf, do not hear. And as a mute one who does not open his mouth.
\v 14 Indeed, I am as a man who does not hear, \qac ǁ\qac* And in his mouth are no reproofs.
\v 15 Because for You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, I have waited, \qac ǁ\qac* You answer, O Lord my God.
\v 16 When I said, “Lest they rejoice over me, \qac ǁ\qac* In the slipping of my foot they magnified themselves against me.”
\v 17 For I am ready to halt, \qac ǁ\qac* And my pain [is] continually before me.
\v 18 For I declare my iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* I am sorry for my sin.
\v 19 And my enemies [are] lively, \qac ǁ\qac* They have been strong, and those hating me without cause, \qac ǁ\qac* Have been multiplied.
\v 20 And those paying evil for good accuse me, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of my pursuing good.
\v 21 Do not forsake me, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* My God, do not be far from me,
\v 22 Hurry to help me, O Lord, my salvation!

\v 1 I have said, “I observe my ways, \qac ǁ\qac* Against sinning with my tongue, \qac ǁ\qac* I keep a curb for my mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* While the wicked [is] before me.”
\v 2 I was mute [with] silence, \qac ǁ\qac* I kept silent from good, and my pain is excited.
\v 3 My heart [is] hot within me, \qac ǁ\qac* In my meditating the fire burns, \qac ǁ\qac* I have spoken with my tongue.
\v 4 “Cause me to know, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, my end, \qac ǁ\qac* And the measure of my days—what it [is],” \qac ǁ\qac* I know how frail I [am].
\v 5 Behold, You have made my days handbreadths, \qac ǁ\qac* And my age [is] as nothing before You, \qac ǁ\qac* Only, every man set up [is] all vanity. Selah.
\v 6 Only, each habitually walks in an image, \qac ǁ\qac* Only, [in] vain, they are disquieted, \qac ǁ\qac* He heaps up and does not know who gathers them.
\v 7 And now, what have I expected? O Lord, my hope—it [is] of You.
\v 8 Deliver me from all my transgressions, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not make me a reproach of the fool.
\v 9 I have been mute, I do not open my mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* Because You have done [it].
\v 10 Turn aside Your stroke from off me, \qac ǁ\qac* From the striving of Your hand I have been consumed.
\v 11 With reproofs against iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* You have corrected man, \qac ǁ\qac* And dissolve his desirableness as a moth, \qac ǁ\qac* Only, every man [is] vanity. Selah.
\v 12 Hear my prayer, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And give ear [to] my cry, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not be silent to my tear, \qac ǁ\qac* For I [am] a sojourner with You, \qac ǁ\qac* A settler like all my fathers.

\v 1 I have diligently expected \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And He inclines to me, and hears my cry,
\v 2 And He causes me to come up \qac ǁ\qac* From a pit of desolation—from mire of mud, \qac ǁ\qac* And He raises up my feet on a rock, \qac ǁ\qac* He is establishing my steps.
\v 3 And He puts a new song in my mouth, “Praise to our God.” Many see and fear, and trust in \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 4 O the blessedness of the man \qac ǁ\qac* Who has made \nd Yhwh\nd* his trust, \qac ǁ\qac* And has not turned to the proud, \qac ǁ\qac* And those turning aside to lies.
\v 5 You have done much, my God \nd Yhwh\nd*; Your wonders and Your thoughts toward us, \qac ǁ\qac* There is none to arrange to You, \qac ǁ\qac* I declare and speak: They have been more than to be numbered.
\v 6 Sacrifice and present You have not desired, \qac ǁ\qac* But a body You have prepared for me, \qac ǁ\qac* Burnt and sin-offering You have not asked.
\v 7 Then I said, “Behold, I have come, \qac ǁ\qac* In the roll of the scroll it is written of me,
\v 8 I have delighted to do Your pleasure, my God, \qac ǁ\qac* And Your law [is] within my heart.”
\v 9 I have proclaimed tidings of righteousness \qac ǁ\qac* In the great assembly, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, I do not restrain my lips, \qac ǁ\qac* O \nd Yhwh\nd*, You have known.
\v 10 I have not concealed Your righteousness \qac ǁ\qac* In the midst of my heart, \qac ǁ\qac* I have told of Your faithfulness and Your salvation, \qac ǁ\qac* I have not hidden Your kindness and Your truth, \qac ǁ\qac* To the great assembly.
\v 11 You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, do not restrain Your mercies from me, \qac ǁ\qac* Your kindness and Your truth continually keep me.
\v 12 For innumerable evils have surrounded me, \qac ǁ\qac* My iniquities have overtaken me, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have not been able to see; They have been more than the hairs of my head, \qac ǁ\qac* And my heart has forsaken me.
\v 13 Be pleased, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, to deliver me, \qac ǁ\qac* O \nd Yhwh\nd*, make haste for my help.
\v 14 They are ashamed and confounded together, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are seeking my soul to destroy it, \qac ǁ\qac* They are turned backward, \qac ǁ\qac* And are ashamed, who are desiring my evil.
\v 15 They are desolate because of their shame, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are saying to me, “Aha, aha.”
\v 16 All seeking You rejoice and are glad in You, \qac ǁ\qac* Those loving Your salvation continually say, “\nd Yhwh\nd* is magnified.”

\v 2 \nd Yhwh\nd* preserves him and revives him, \qac ǁ\qac* He is blessed in the land, \qac ǁ\qac* And You do not give him into the will of his enemies.
\v 3 \nd Yhwh\nd* supports [him] on a bed of sickness, \qac ǁ\qac* You have turned his bed in his weakness.
\v 4 I said, “O \nd Yhwh\nd*, favor me, \qac ǁ\qac* Heal my soul, for I sinned against You,”

\v 6 And if he came to see—he speaks vanity, \qac ǁ\qac* His heart gathers iniquity to itself, \qac ǁ\qac* He goes out—at the street he speaks.
\v 7 All hating me whisper together against me, \qac ǁ\qac* Against me they devise evil to me:

\v 5 Why bow yourself, O my soul? Indeed, are you troubled within me? Wait for God, for I still confess Him: The salvation of my countenance—my God!
\v 6 My soul bows itself in me, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore I remember You from the land of Jordan, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the Hermons, from Mount Mizar.

\v 1 O God, we have heard with our ears, \qac ǁ\qac* Our fathers have recounted to us, \qac ǁ\qac* The work You worked in their days, \qac ǁ\qac* In the days of old.
\v 2 You, [with] Your hand, have dispossessed nations. And You plant them. You afflict peoples, and send them away.
\v 3 For they did not possess the land by their sword, \qac ǁ\qac* And their arm did not give salvation to them, \qac ǁ\qac* But Your right hand, and Your arm, \qac ǁ\qac* And the light of Your countenance, \qac ǁ\qac* Because You had accepted them.
\v 4 You [are] He, my King, O God, \qac ǁ\qac* Command the deliverances of Jacob.
\v 5 By You we push our adversaries, \qac ǁ\qac* By Your Name we tread down our withstanders,
\v 6 For I do not trust in my bow, \qac ǁ\qac* And my sword does not save me.
\v 7 For You have saved us from our adversaries, \qac ǁ\qac* And You have put to shame those hating us.
\v 8 In God we have boasted all the day, \qac ǁ\qac* And we thank Your Name for all time. Selah.
\v 9 In anger You have cast off and cause us to blush, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not go forth with our hosts.
\v 10 You cause us to turn backward from an adversary, \qac ǁ\qac* And those hating us, \qac ǁ\qac* Have spoiled for themselves.
\v 11 You make us food like sheep, \qac ǁ\qac* And You have scattered us among nations.
\v 12 You sell Your people—without wealth, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not become great by their price.
\v 13 You make us a reproach to our neighbors, \qac ǁ\qac* A scorn and a reproach to our surrounders.
\v 14 You make us an allegory among nations, \qac ǁ\qac* A shaking of the head among peoples.
\v 15 All the day my confusion [is] before me, \qac ǁ\qac* And the shame of my face has covered me.
\v 16 Because of the voice of a reproacher and reviler, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of an enemy and a self-avenger.
\v 17 All this met us, and we did not forget You, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor have we dealt falsely in Your covenant.
\v 18 We do not turn our heart backward, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor turn aside our step from Your path.
\v 19 But You have struck us in a place of dragons, \qac ǁ\qac* And cover us over with death-shade.
\v 20 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, \qac ǁ\qac* And spread our hands to a strange God,
\v 21 Does God not search this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart.
\v 22 Surely, for Your sake we have been slain all the day, \qac ǁ\qac* Reckoned as sheep of the slaughter.
\v 23 Stir up—why do You sleep, O Lord? Awake, do not cast us off forever.
\v 24 Why do You hide Your face? You forget our afflictions and our oppression,
\v 25 For our soul has bowed to the dust, \qac ǁ\qac* Our belly has cleaved to the earth.

\v 5 Why do I fear in days of evil? The iniquity of my supplanters surrounds me.
\v 6 Those trusting on their wealth, \qac ǁ\qac* And in the multitude of their riches, \qac ǁ\qac* Show themselves foolish.
\v 7 A brother ransoms no one at all, \qac ǁ\qac* He does not give to God his atonement.
\v 8 And precious [is] the redemption of their soul, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has ceased for all time.

\d A Psalm of Asaph.
\p
\v 1 The God of gods—\nd Yhwh\nd*—has spoken, \qac ǁ\qac* And He calls to the earth \qac ǁ\qac* From the rising of the sun to its going in.
\v 2 From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shone.
\v 3 Our God comes, and is not silent, \qac ǁ\qac* Fire devours before Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And around Him it has been very tempestuous.
\v 4 He calls to the heavens from above, \qac ǁ\qac* And to the earth, to judge His people.
\v 5 Gather My saints to Me, \qac ǁ\qac* Making covenant with Me over a sacrifice.
\v 6 And the heavens declare His righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* For God Himself is judging. Selah.
\v 7 Hear, O My people, and I speak, \qac ǁ\qac* O Israel, and I testify against you, \qac ǁ\qac* God—I [am] your God.
\v 8 I do not reprove you for your sacrifices, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, your burnt-offerings \qac ǁ\qac* [Are] continually before Me.
\v 9 I do not take a bullock from your house, \qac ǁ\qac* [Or] male goats from your folds.
\v 10 For every beast of the forest [is] Mine, \qac ǁ\qac* The livestock on the hills of oxen.
\v 11 I have known every bird of the mountains, \qac ǁ\qac* And the wild beast of the field [is] with Me.
\v 12 If I am hungry I do not tell [it] to you, \qac ǁ\qac* For the world and its fullness [is] Mine.
\v 13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls, \qac ǁ\qac* And drink the blood of male goats?
\v 14 Sacrifice to God confession, \qac ǁ\qac* And complete your vows to the Most High.
\v 15 And call Me in a day of adversity, \qac ǁ\qac* I deliver you, and you honor Me.
\v 16 And to the wicked God has said: What to you—to recount My statutes? That you lift up My covenant on your mouth?
\v 17 Indeed, you have hated instruction, \qac ǁ\qac* And cast My words behind you.
\v 18 If you have seen a thief, \qac ǁ\qac* Then you are pleased with him, \qac ǁ\qac* And your portion [is] with adulterers.
\v 19 You have sent forth your mouth with evil, \qac ǁ\qac* And your tongue joins deceit together,
\v 20 You sit, you speak against your brother, \qac ǁ\qac* You give slander against a son of your mother.
\v 21 These you did, and I kept silent, \qac ǁ\qac* You have thought that I am like you, \qac ǁ\qac* I reprove you, and set in array before your eyes.
\v 22 Now understand this, \qac ǁ\qac* You who are forgetting God, \qac ǁ\qac* Lest I tear, and there is no deliverer.
\v 23 He who is sacrificing praise honors Me, \qac ǁ\qac* As for him who makes a way, \qac ǁ\qac* I cause him to look on the salvation of God!

\p
\v 1 Favor me, O God, according to Your kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* According to the abundance of Your mercies, \qac ǁ\qac* Blot out my transgressions.
\v 2 Thoroughly wash me from my iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* And cleanse me from my sin,
\v 3 For I know my transgressions, \qac ǁ\qac* And my sin [is] continually before me.
\v 4 Against You, You only, I have sinned, \qac ǁ\qac* And done evil in Your eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* So that You are righteous in Your words, \qac ǁ\qac* You are pure in Your judging.
\v 5 Behold, I have been brought forth in iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* And my mother conceives me in sin.
\v 6 Behold, You have desired truth in the inward parts, \qac ǁ\qac* And in the hidden part You cause me to know Wisdom.
\v 7 You cleanse me with hyssop and I am clean, \qac ǁ\qac* Wash me, and I am whiter than snow.
\v 8 You cause me to hear joy and gladness, \qac ǁ\qac* You make bones You have bruised joyful.
\v 9 Hide Your face from my sin. And blot out all my iniquities.
\v 10 Create for me a clean heart, O God, \qac ǁ\qac* And renew a right spirit within me.
\v 11 Do not cast me forth from Your presence, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.
\v 12 Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, \qac ǁ\qac* And a willing spirit sustains me.
\v 13 I teach transgressors Your ways, \qac ǁ\qac* And sinners return to You.
\v 14 Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, \qac ǁ\qac* My tongue sings of Your righteousness.
\v 15 O Lord, you open my lips, \qac ǁ\qac* And my mouth declares Your praise.
\v 16 For You do not desire sacrifice, or I give [it], \qac ǁ\qac* You do not accept burnt-offering.
\v 17 The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit, \qac ǁ\qac* A heart broken and bruised, O God, \qac ǁ\qac* You do not despise.
\v 18 Do good in Your good pleasure with Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* You build the walls of Jerusalem.
\v 19 Then You desire sacrifices of righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* Burnt-offering, and whole burnt-offering, \qac ǁ\qac* Then they offer bullocks on your altar!

\v 1 Why do you boast in evil, O mighty one? The kindness of God [is] all the day.
\v 2 Your tongue devises mischiefs, \qac ǁ\qac* Like a sharp razor, working deceit.
\v 3 You have loved evil rather than good, \qac ǁ\qac* Lying, than speaking righteousness. Selah.
\v 4 You have loved all devouring words, \qac ǁ\qac* O you deceitful tongue.
\v 5 Also—God breaks you down forever, \qac ǁ\qac* Takes you, and pulls you out of the tent, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has uprooted you \qac ǁ\qac* Out of the land of the living. Selah.
\v 6 And the righteous see, \qac ǁ\qac* And fear, and laugh at him.
\v 7 “Behold, the man who does not make God his strong place, \qac ǁ\qac* And trusts in the abundance of his riches, \qac ǁ\qac* He is strong in his mischiefs.”
\v 8 And I, as a green olive in the house of God, \qac ǁ\qac* I have trusted in the kindness of God, \qac ǁ\qac* For all time and forever,
\v 9 I thank You for all time, because You have done [it], \qac ǁ\qac* And I wait [on] Your Name for [it is] good before Your saints!

\v 1 A fool said in his heart, “There is no God.” They have done corruptly, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, they have done abominable iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* There is none doing good.
\v 2 God looked on the sons of men from the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* To see if there is an understanding one, \qac ǁ\qac* [One] seeking God.
\v 3 Everyone went back, together they became filthy, \qac ǁ\qac* There is none doing good—not even one.
\v 4 Workers of iniquity have not known, \qac ǁ\qac* Those eating my people have eaten bread, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not called God.
\v 5 There they feared a fear—there was no fear, \qac ǁ\qac* For God has scattered the bones of him \qac ǁ\qac* Who is encamping against you, \qac ǁ\qac* You have put to shame, \qac ǁ\qac* For God has despised them.

\v 2 O God, hear my prayer, \qac ǁ\qac* Give ear to the sayings of my mouth,

\v 2 Attend to me, and answer me, \qac ǁ\qac* I mourn in my meditation, and make a noise,
\v 3 Because of the voice of an enemy, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of the oppression of the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* For they cause sorrow to move against me, \qac ǁ\qac* And in anger they hate me.
\v 4 My heart is pained within me, \qac ǁ\qac* And terrors of death have fallen on me.
\v 5 Fear and trembling come to me, \qac ǁ\qac* And horror covers me.
\v 6 And I say, “Who gives to me a pinion as a dove?” I fly away and rest,
\v 7 Behold, I move far off, \qac ǁ\qac* I lodge in a wilderness. Selah.
\v 8 I hurry escape for myself, \qac ǁ\qac* From a rushing wind, from a whirlwind.
\v 9 Swallow up, O Lord, divide their tongue, \qac ǁ\qac* For I saw violence and strife in a city.
\v 10 By day and by night they go around it, on its walls. Both iniquity and perverseness [are] in its midst,
\v 11 Mischiefs [are] in its midst. Fraud and deceit do not depart from its street.
\v 12 For an enemy does not reproach me, or I bear [it], \qac ǁ\qac* He who is hating me \qac ǁ\qac* Has not magnified himself against me, \qac ǁ\qac* Or I hide from him.
\v 13 But you, a man—as my equal, \qac ǁ\qac* My familiar friend, and my acquaintance.
\v 14 When together we sweeten counsel, \qac ǁ\qac* We walk into the house of God in company.
\v 15 Desolations [are] on them, \qac ǁ\qac* They go down [to] Sheol—alive, \qac ǁ\qac* For wickedness [is] in their dwelling, in their midst.
\v 16 I call to God, and \nd Yhwh\nd* saves me.
\v 17 Evening, and morning, and noon, \qac ǁ\qac* I meditate, and make a noise, and He hears my voice,
\v 18 He has ransomed my soul in peace \qac ǁ\qac* From him who is near to me, \qac ǁ\qac* For with the multitude they were with me.
\v 19 God hears and afflicts them, \qac ǁ\qac* And He sits of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, and do not fear God,
\v 20 He has sent forth his hands against his well-wishers, \qac ǁ\qac* He has defiled his covenant.
\v 21 His mouth has been sweeter than honey, \qac ǁ\qac* And his heart [is] war! His words have been softer than oil, \qac ǁ\qac* And they [are] drawn [swords].
\v 22 Cast on \nd Yhwh\nd* that which He has given you, \qac ǁ\qac* And He sustains you, \qac ǁ\qac* He does not permit the moving of the righteous forever.

\v 6 They search out perverse things, “We perfected a searching search,” \qac ǁ\qac* And the inward part of man, and the heart, [are] deep.
\v 7 And God shoots them [with] an arrow, \qac ǁ\qac* Their wounds have been sudden,
\v 8 And they cause him to stumble, \qac ǁ\qac* Their own tongue [is] against them, \qac ǁ\qac* Every looker on them flees away.

\v 2 Hearer of prayer, all flesh comes to You.
\v 3 Matters of iniquities were mightier than I, \qac ǁ\qac* Our transgressions—You cover them.
\v 4 O the blessedness of [him whom] You choose, \qac ǁ\qac* And draw near, he inhabits Your courts, \qac ǁ\qac* We are satisfied with the goodness of Your house, \qac ǁ\qac* Your holy temple.
\v 5 By fearful things in righteousness You answer us, \qac ǁ\qac* O God of our salvation, \qac ǁ\qac* The confidence of all far off \qac ǁ\qac* The ends of the earth and sea.
\v 6 Establishing mountains by His power, \qac ǁ\qac* He has been girded with might,
\v 7 Restraining the noise of seas, the noise of their billows, \qac ǁ\qac* And the multitude of the peoples.
\v 8 And the inhabitants of the uttermost parts \qac ǁ\qac* Are afraid from Your signs, \qac ǁ\qac* You cause the outgoings of morning and evening to sing.
\v 9 You have inspected the earth, and water it, \qac ǁ\qac* You make it very rich, the stream of God [is] full of water, \qac ǁ\qac* You prepare their grain, \qac ǁ\qac* When thus You prepare it,
\v 10 Its ridges have been filled, \qac ǁ\qac* Its furrow has been deepened, \qac ǁ\qac* You soften it with showers, \qac ǁ\qac* Its springing up You bless.
\v 11 You have crowned the year of Your goodness, \qac ǁ\qac* And Your paths drop fatness.
\v 12 The pastures of a wilderness drop, \qac ǁ\qac* And You gird the hills with joy.
\v 13 The meadows are clothed with the flock, \qac ǁ\qac* And valleys are covered with grain, \qac ǁ\qac* They shout—indeed, they sing!

\v 4 All the earth bows to You, \qac ǁ\qac* They sing praise to You, they praise Your Name.” Selah.
\v 5 Come, and see the works of God, \qac ǁ\qac* Fearful acts toward the sons of men.
\v 6 He has turned a sea to dry land, \qac ǁ\qac* Through a river they pass over on foot, \qac ǁ\qac* There we rejoice in Him.
\v 7 Ruling by His might for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* His eyes watch among the nations, \qac ǁ\qac* The stubborn do not exalt themselves. Selah.
\v 8 Bless our God you peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* And sound the voice of His praise,
\v 9 Who has placed our soul in life, \qac ǁ\qac* And has not permitted our feet to be moved.
\v 10 For You have tried us, O God, \qac ǁ\qac* You have refined us as the refining of silver.
\v 11 You have brought us into a net, \qac ǁ\qac* You have placed pressure on our loins.
\v 12 You have caused man to ride at our head. We have entered into fire and into water, \qac ǁ\qac* And You bring us out to a watered place.
\v 13 I enter Your house with burnt-offerings, \qac ǁ\qac* I complete my vows to You,
\v 14 For my lips were opened, \qac ǁ\qac* And my mouth spoke in my distress:
\v 15 “I offer to You burnt-offerings of fatlings, \qac ǁ\qac* With incense of rams, I prepare a bullock with male goats.” Selah.
\v 16 Come, hear, all you who fear God, \qac ǁ\qac* And I recount what He did for my soul.
\v 17 I have called to Him [with] my mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* And exaltation [is] under my tongue.
\v 18 Iniquity, if I have seen in my heart, \qac ǁ\qac* The Lord does not hear.
\v 19 But God has heard, \qac ǁ\qac* He has attended to the voice of my prayer.

\v 1 Save me, O God, for waters have come to the soul.
\v 2 I have sunk in deep mire, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is no standing, \qac ǁ\qac* I have come into the depths of the waters, \qac ǁ\qac* And a flood has overflown me.
\v 3 I have been wearied with my calling, \qac ǁ\qac* My throat has been burned, \qac ǁ\qac* My eyes have been consumed, waiting for my God.
\v 4 Those hating me without cause \qac ǁ\qac* Have been more than the hairs of my head, \qac ǁ\qac* Mighty have been my destroyers, \qac ǁ\qac* My lying enemies, \qac ǁ\qac* That which I did not take away—I bring back.
\v 5 O God, You have known \qac ǁ\qac* Concerning my overturn, \qac ǁ\qac* And my desolations have not been hid from You.
\v 6 Do not let those waiting on You be ashamed because of me, \qac ǁ\qac* O Lord, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not let those seeking You \qac ǁ\qac* Blush because of me, \qac ǁ\qac* O God of Israel.
\v 7 For because of You I have borne reproach, \qac ǁ\qac* Shame has covered my face.
\v 8 I have been a stranger to my brother, \qac ǁ\qac* And a foreigner to sons of my mother.
\v 9 For [my] zeal for Your house has consumed me, \qac ǁ\qac* And the reproaches of Your reproachers \qac ǁ\qac* Have fallen on me.
\v 10 And I weep in the fasting of my soul, \qac ǁ\qac* And it is for a reproach to me.
\v 11 And I make my clothing sackcloth, \qac ǁ\qac* And I am for an allegory to them.
\v 12 Those sitting at the gate meditate concerning me, \qac ǁ\qac* And those drinking strong drink, \qac ǁ\qac* Play on instruments.
\v 13 And my prayer [is] to You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* A time of good pleasure, O God, \qac ǁ\qac* In the abundance of Your kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* Answer me in the truth of Your salvation.
\v 14 Deliver me from the mire, and do not let me sink, \qac ǁ\qac* Let me be delivered from those hating me, \qac ǁ\qac* And from deep places of waters.
\v 15 Do not let a flood of waters overflow me, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor let the deep swallow me up, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor let the pit shut her mouth on me.
\v 16 Answer me, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, for Your kindness [is] good, \qac ǁ\qac* Turn to me according to the abundance of Your mercies,
\v 17 And do not hide Your face from Your servant, \qac ǁ\qac* For I am in distress—hurry, answer me.
\v 18 Be near to my soul—redeem it, \qac ǁ\qac* Ransom me because of my enemies.
\v 19 You have known my reproach, \qac ǁ\qac* And my shame, and my blushing, \qac ǁ\qac* All my adversaries [are] before You.
\v 20 Reproach has broken my heart, and I am sick, \qac ǁ\qac* And I look for a bemoaner, and there is none, \qac ǁ\qac* And for comforters, and I have found none.
\v 21 And they give gall for my food, \qac ǁ\qac* And cause me to drink vinegar for my thirst.
\v 22 Their table before them is for a snare, \qac ǁ\qac* And for a repayment—for a trap.
\v 23 Their eyes are darkened from seeing, \qac ǁ\qac* And their loins continually shake You.
\v 24 Pour Your indignation on them, \qac ǁ\qac* And the fierceness of Your anger seizes them.
\v 25 Their tower is desolated, \qac ǁ\qac* There is no dweller in their tents.
\v 26 For they have pursued him [whom] You have struck, \qac ǁ\qac* And recount of the pain of Your pierced ones.
\v 27 Give punishment for their iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* And they do not enter into Your righteousness.
\v 28 They are blotted out of the scroll of life, \qac ǁ\qac* And are not written with the righteous.
\v 29 And I [am] afflicted and pained, \qac ǁ\qac* Your salvation, O God, sets me on high.
\v 30 I praise the Name of God with a song, \qac ǁ\qac* And I magnify Him with thanksgiving,
\v 31 And it is better to \nd Yhwh\nd* than an ox, \qac ǁ\qac* A bullock—horned [and] hoofed.
\v 32 The humble have seen—they rejoice, \qac ǁ\qac* You who seek God—and your heart lives.
\v 33 For \nd Yhwh\nd* listens to the needy, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has not despised His bound ones.
\v 34 The heavens and earth praise Him, \qac ǁ\qac* Seas, and every moving thing in them.
\v 35 For God saves Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* And builds the cities of Judah, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have dwelt there, and possess it.
\v 36 And the seed of His servants inherit it, \qac ǁ\qac* And those loving His Name dwell in it!

\v 1 Surely God [is] good to Israel, to the clean of heart. And I—as a little thing, \qac ǁ\qac* My feet have been turned aside,
\v 2 As nothing, my steps have slipped, \qac ǁ\qac* For I have been envious of the boastful,
\v 3 I see the peace of the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* That there are no bands at their death,
\v 4 And their might [is] firm.
\v 5 They are not in the misery of mortals, \qac ǁ\qac* And they are not plagued with common men.
\v 6 Therefore pride has encircled them, \qac ǁ\qac* Violence covers them as a dress.
\v 7 Their eye has come out from fat. The imaginations of the heart transgressed;
\v 8 They do corruptly, \qac ǁ\qac* And they speak in the wickedness of oppression, \qac ǁ\qac* They speak from on high.
\v 9 They have set their mouth in the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* And their tongue walks in the earth.
\v 10 Therefore His people return here, \qac ǁ\qac* And waters of fullness are wrung out to them.
\v 11 And they have said, “How has God known? And is there knowledge in the Most High?”
\v 12 Behold, these [are] the wicked and easy ones of the age, \qac ǁ\qac* They have increased strength.
\v 13 Only—a vain thing! I have purified my heart, \qac ǁ\qac* And I wash my hands in innocence,
\v 14 And I am plagued all the day, \qac ǁ\qac* And my reproof—every morning.
\v 15 If I have said, “I recount thus,” \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, I have deceived a generation of Your sons.
\v 16 And I think to know this, \qac ǁ\qac* It [is] perverseness in my eyes,
\v 17 Until I come into the sanctuaries of God, \qac ǁ\qac* I attend to their latter end.
\v 18 Surely You set them in slippery places, \qac ǁ\qac* You have caused them to fall to desolations.
\v 19 How they have become a desolation as in a moment, \qac ǁ\qac* They have been ended—consumed from terrors.
\v 20 As a dream from awakening, O Lord, \qac ǁ\qac* In awaking, You despise their image.
\v 21 For my heart shows itself violent, \qac ǁ\qac* And my reins prick themselves,
\v 22 And I am brutish, and do not know. I have been a beast with You.
\v 23 And I [am] continually with You, \qac ǁ\qac* You have laid hold on my right hand.
\v 24 You lead me with Your counsel, \qac ǁ\qac* And after, receive me [to] glory.

\v 3 Lift up Your steps to the continuous desolations, \qac ǁ\qac* Everything the enemy did wickedly in the sanctuary.
\v 4 Your adversaries have roared, \qac ǁ\qac* In the midst of Your meeting-places, \qac ǁ\qac* They have set their ensigns as ensigns.
\v 5 He is known as one bringing in on high \qac ǁ\qac* Against a thicket of wood—axes.
\v 6 And now they break down its engravings, \qac ǁ\qac* Together, with axe and hatchet,
\v 7 They have sent Your sanctuary into fire, \qac ǁ\qac* They defiled the Dwelling Place of Your Name to the earth,
\v 8 They said in their hearts, “Let us oppress them together,” \qac ǁ\qac* They burned all the meeting-places of God in the land.
\v 9 We have not seen our ensigns, \qac ǁ\qac* There is no longer a prophet, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor with us is one knowing how long.
\v 10 Until when, O God, does an adversary reproach? Does an enemy despise Your Name forever?
\v 11 Why do You turn back Your hand, \qac ǁ\qac* Even Your right hand? Remove [it] from the midst of Your bosom.
\v 12 And God [is] my king of old, \qac ǁ\qac* Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
\v 13 You have divided [the] sea by Your strength, \qac ǁ\qac* You have shattered heads of dragons by the waters,
\v 14 You have broken the heads of leviathan, \qac ǁ\qac* You make him food for the people of desert-dwellers.
\v 15 You have cleaved a fountain and a stream, \qac ǁ\qac* You have dried up perennial flowings.
\v 16 The day [is] Yours, \qac ǁ\qac* The night [is] also Yours, \qac ǁ\qac* You have prepared a light-giver—the sun.
\v 17 You have set up all the borders of earth, \qac ǁ\qac* Summer and winter—You have formed them.
\v 18 Remember this—an enemy reproached \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And a foolish people have despised Your Name.
\v 19 Do not give up to a [wild] creature, \qac ǁ\qac* The soul of Your turtle-dove, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not forget the life of Your poor ones forever.
\v 20 Look attentively to the covenant, \qac ǁ\qac* For the dark places of earth, \qac ǁ\qac* Have been full of habitations of violence.
\v 21 Do not let the oppressed turn back ashamed, \qac ǁ\qac* Let the poor and needy praise Your Name,
\v 22 Arise, O God, plead Your plea, \qac ǁ\qac* Remember Your reproach from a fool all the day.
\v 23 Do not forget the voice of Your adversaries, \qac ǁ\qac* The noise of Your withstanders is going up continually!

\v 2 When I receive an appointment, I judge uprightly.
\v 3 The earth and all its inhabitants are melted, \qac ǁ\qac* I have pondered its pillars. Selah.
\v 4 I have said to the boastful, “Do not be boastful,” \qac ǁ\qac* And to the wicked, “Do not raise up a horn.”
\v 5 Do not raise up your horn on high \qac ǁ\qac* (You speak with a stiff neck).
\v 6 For not from the east, or from the west, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor from the wilderness—[is] elevation.
\v 7 But God [is] judging, \qac ǁ\qac* This He makes low—and this He lifts up.
\v 8 For a cup [is] in the hand of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And the wine has foamed, \qac ǁ\qac* It is full of mixture, and He pours out of it, \qac ǁ\qac* Surely wring out its dregs, \qac ǁ\qac* And all the wicked of the earth drink,
\v 9 And I declare [it] for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* I sing praise to the God of Jacob.
\v 10 And I cut off all horns of the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* The horns of the righteous are exalted!

\v 7 You, fearful [are] You, \qac ǁ\qac* And who stands before You, \qac ǁ\qac* Since You have been angry?
\v 8 You have sounded judgment from the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* Earth has feared, and has been still,
\v 9 In the rising of God to judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* To save all the humble of earth. Selah.
\v 10 For the fierceness of man praises You, \qac ǁ\qac* You gird on the remnant of fierceness.
\v 11 Vow and complete to your God \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* All you surrounding Him, \qac ǁ\qac* They bring presents to the Fearful One.

\v 1 My voice [is] to God, and I cry, \qac ǁ\qac* My voice [is] to God, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has given ear to me.
\v 2 I sought the Lord in a day of my distress, \qac ǁ\qac* My hand has been spread out by night, \qac ǁ\qac* And it does not cease, \qac ǁ\qac* My soul has refused to be comforted.
\v 3 I remember God, and make a noise, \qac ǁ\qac* I meditate, and my spirit is feeble. Selah.
\v 4 You have taken hold of the watches of my eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* I have been moved, and I do not speak.
\v 5 I have reckoned the days of old, \qac ǁ\qac* The years of the ages.
\v 6 I remember my music in the night, \qac ǁ\qac* I meditate with my heart, and my spirit searches diligently:
\v 7 Does the Lord cast off for all ages? Does He add to be pleased no longer?
\v 8 Has His kindness ceased forever? The saying failed from generation to generation?
\v 9 Has God forgotten [His] favors? Has He shut up His mercies in anger? Selah.
\v 10 And I say: “My weakness is, \qac ǁ\qac* The changes of the right hand of the Most High.”
\v 11 I mention the doings of \nd Yah\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* For I remember Your wonders of old,
\v 12 And I have meditated on all Your working, \qac ǁ\qac* And I talk concerning Your doings.
\v 13 O God, Your way [is] in holiness, \qac ǁ\qac* Who [is] a great god like God?
\v 14 You [are] the God doing wonders. You have made Your strength known among the peoples,
\v 15 You have redeemed Your people with strength, \qac ǁ\qac* The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
\v 16 The waters have seen You, O God, \qac ǁ\qac* The waters have seen You, \qac ǁ\qac* They are afraid—also depths are troubled.
\v 17 Thick clouds have poured out waters, \qac ǁ\qac* The skies have given forth a noise, \qac ǁ\qac* Also—Your arrows go up and down.
\v 18 The voice of Your thunder [is] in the spheres, \qac ǁ\qac* Lightnings have lightened the world, \qac ǁ\qac* The earth has trembled, indeed, it shakes.
\v 19 Your way [is] in the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* And Your paths in many waters, \qac ǁ\qac* And Your tracks have not been known.

\d An Instruction of Asaph.
\p
\v 1 Give ear, O my people, to my law, \qac ǁ\qac* Incline your ear to sayings of my mouth.
\v 2 I open my mouth with an allegory, \qac ǁ\qac* I bring forth hidden things of old,
\v 3 That we have heard and know, \qac ǁ\qac* And our fathers have recounted to us.
\v 4 We do not hide from their sons, \qac ǁ\qac* Recounting praises of \nd Yhwh\nd* to a later generation, \qac ǁ\qac* And His strength, and His wonders that He has done.
\v 5 And He raises up a testimony in Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And has placed a law in Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* That He commanded our fathers, \qac ǁ\qac* To make them known to their sons.
\v 6 So that a later generation knows, \qac ǁ\qac* Sons who are born, rise and recount to their sons,
\v 7 And place their confidence in God, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not forget the doings of God, \qac ǁ\qac* But keep His commands.
\v 8 And they are not like their fathers, \qac ǁ\qac* A generation apostatizing and being rebellious, \qac ǁ\qac* A generation—it has not prepared its heart, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor [is] its spirit steadfast with God.
\v 9 Sons of Ephraim—armed bearers of bow, \qac ǁ\qac* Have turned in a day of conflict.
\v 10 They have not kept the covenant of God, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have refused to walk in His law,
\v 11 And they forget His doings, \qac ǁ\qac* And His wonders that He showed them.
\v 12 He has done wonders before their fathers, \qac ǁ\qac* In the land of Egypt—the field of Zoan.
\v 13 He cleft a sea, and causes them to pass over, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, He causes waters to stand as a heap.
\v 14 And leads them with a cloud by day, \qac ǁ\qac* And with a light of fire all the night.
\v 15 He cleaves rocks in a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* And gives drink—as the great deep.
\v 16 And brings out streams from a rock, \qac ǁ\qac* And causes waters to come down as rivers.
\v 17 And they still add to sin against Him, \qac ǁ\qac* To provoke the Most High in the dry place.
\v 18 And they try God in their heart, \qac ǁ\qac* To ask food for their lust.
\v 19 And they speak against God—they said: “Is God able to array a table in a wilderness?”
\v 20 Behold, He has struck a rock, \qac ǁ\qac* And waters flow, indeed, streams overflow. “Also, [is] He able to give bread? Does He prepare flesh for His people?”
\v 21 Therefore \nd Yhwh\nd* has heard, \qac ǁ\qac* And He shows Himself angry, \qac ǁ\qac* And fire has been kindled against Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And anger has also gone up against Israel,
\v 22 For they have not believed in God, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor have they trusted in His salvation.
\v 23 And He commands clouds from above, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, He has opened doors of the heavens.
\v 24 And He rains manna on them to eat, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, He has given grain of the heavens to them.
\v 25 Each has eaten food of the mighty, \qac ǁ\qac* He sent provision to them to satiety.
\v 26 He causes an east wind to journey in the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* And leads a south wind by His strength,
\v 27 And He rains on them flesh as dust, \qac ǁ\qac* And as sand of the seas—winged bird,
\v 28 And causes [it] to fall in the midst of His camp, \qac ǁ\qac* Around His dwelling places.
\v 29 And they eat, and are greatly satisfied, \qac ǁ\qac* And He brings their desire to them.
\v 30 They have not been estranged from their desire, \qac ǁ\qac* Their food [is] yet in their mouth,
\v 31 And the anger of God has gone up against them, \qac ǁ\qac* And He slays among their fat ones, \qac ǁ\qac* And He caused youths of Israel to bend.
\v 32 With all this they have sinned again, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not believed in His wonders.
\v 33 And He consumes their days in vanity, \qac ǁ\qac* And their years in trouble.
\v 34 If He slew them, then they sought Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And turned back, and earnestly sought God,
\v 35 And they remember that God [is] their rock, \qac ǁ\qac* And God Most High their redeemer.
\v 36 And they deceive Him with their mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* And lie to Him with their tongue,
\v 37 And their heart has not been right with Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have not been steadfast in His covenant.
\v 38 And He, the Merciful One, pardons iniquity, and does not destroy, \qac ǁ\qac* And has often turned back His anger, \qac ǁ\qac* And does not awaken all His fury.
\v 39 And He remembers that they [are] flesh, \qac ǁ\qac* A wind going on—and it does not return.
\v 40 How often do they provoke Him in the wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* Grieve Him in the desolate place?
\v 41 Indeed, they turn back, and try God, \qac ǁ\qac* And have limited the Holy One of Israel.
\v 42 They have not remembered His hand \qac ǁ\qac* The day He ransomed them from the adversary.
\v 43 When He set His signs in Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And His wonders in the field of Zoan,
\v 44 And He turns their streams to blood, \qac ǁ\qac* And they do not drink their floods.
\v 45 He sends among them the beetle, and it consumes them, \qac ǁ\qac* And the frog, and it destroys them,
\v 46 And gives their increase to the caterpillar, \qac ǁ\qac* And their labor to the locust.
\v 47 He destroys their vine with hail, \qac ǁ\qac* And their sycamores with frost,
\v 48 And delivers their beasts up to the hail, \qac ǁ\qac* And their livestock to the burning flames.
\v 49 He sends on them the fury of His anger, \qac ǁ\qac* Wrath, and indignation, and distress—A discharge of evil messengers.
\v 50 He ponders a path for His anger, \qac ǁ\qac* He did not keep back their soul from death, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, He delivered up their life to the pestilence.
\v 51 And He strikes every firstborn in Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* The first-fruit of the strong in tents of Ham.
\v 52 And causes His people to journey as a flock, \qac ǁ\qac* And guides them as a drove in a wilderness,
\v 53 And He leads them confidently, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have not been afraid, \qac ǁ\qac* And the sea has covered their enemies.
\v 54 And He brings them to the border of His sanctuary, \qac ǁ\qac* This mountain His right hand had acquired,
\v 55 And casts out nations from before them, \qac ǁ\qac* And causes them to fall in the line of inheritance, \qac ǁ\qac* And causes the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents,
\v 56 And they tempt and provoke God Most High, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not kept His testimonies.
\v 57 And they turn back, \qac ǁ\qac* And deal treacherously like their fathers, \qac ǁ\qac* They have been turned like a deceitful bow,
\v 58 And make Him angry with their high places, \qac ǁ\qac* And make Him zealous with their carved images,
\v 59 God has heard, and shows Himself angry. And kicks exceedingly against Israel.
\v 60 And He leaves the Dwelling Place of Shiloh, \qac ǁ\qac* The tent He had placed among men,
\v 61 And He gives His strength to captivity, \qac ǁ\qac* And His beauty into the hand of an adversary,
\v 62 And delivers His people up to the sword, \qac ǁ\qac* And showed Himself angry with His inheritance.
\v 63 Fire has consumed His young men, \qac ǁ\qac* And His virgins have not been praised.
\v 64 His priests have fallen by the sword, \qac ǁ\qac* And their widows do not weep.
\v 65 And the Lord wakes as a sleeper, \qac ǁ\qac* As a mighty one crying aloud from wine.
\v 66 And He strikes His adversaries backward, \qac ǁ\qac* He has put a continuous reproach on them,
\v 67 And He kicks against the tent of Joseph, \qac ǁ\qac* And has not fixed on the tribe of Ephraim.
\v 68 And He chooses the tribe of Judah, \qac ǁ\qac* With Mount Zion that He loved,
\v 69 And builds His sanctuary as a high place, \qac ǁ\qac* Like the earth, He founded it for all time.
\v 70 And He fixes on His servant David, \qac ǁ\qac* And takes him from the folds of a flock,
\v 71 He has brought him in from behind suckling ones, \qac ǁ\qac* To rule over Jacob His people, \qac ǁ\qac* And over Israel His inheritance.
\v 72 And he rules them according to the integrity of his heart, \qac ǁ\qac* And leads them by the skillfulness of his hands!

\v 4 We have been a reproach to our neighbors, \qac ǁ\qac* A scorn and a derision to our surrounders.

\v 6 Pour Your fury on the nations who have not known You, \qac ǁ\qac* And on kingdoms that have not called on Your Name.
\v 7 For [one] has devoured Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have made his habitation desolate.
\v 8 Do not remember for us the iniquities of forefathers, \qac ǁ\qac* Hurry, let Your mercies go before us, \qac ǁ\qac* For we have been very weak.

\v 11 Let the groaning of the prisoner come in before You, \qac ǁ\qac* According to the greatness of Your arm, \qac ǁ\qac* Leave the sons of death.
\v 12 And return to our neighbors, \qac ǁ\qac* Sevenfold to their bosom, their reproach, \qac ǁ\qac* With which they reproached You, O Lord.

\v 11 It sends forth its branches to the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* And its shoots to the river.

\v 6 Do You not turn back? You revive us, \qac ǁ\qac* And Your people rejoice in You.
\v 7 Show us, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, your kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* And You give to us Your salvation.
\v 8 I hear what God, \nd Yhwh\nd*, speaks, \qac ǁ\qac* For He speaks peace to His people, \qac ǁ\qac* And to His saints, and they do not turn back to folly.
\v 9 Surely His salvation [is] near to those fearing Him, \qac ǁ\qac* That glory may dwell in our land.
\v 10 Kindness and truth have met, \qac ǁ\qac* Righteousness and peace have kissed,
\v 11 Truth springs up from the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And righteousness looks out from the heavens,
\v 12 \nd Yhwh\nd* also gives that which is good, \qac ǁ\qac* And our land gives its increase.

\v 14 O God, the proud have risen up against me, \qac ǁ\qac* And a company of the terrible sought my soul, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not placed You before them,
\v 15 And You, O Lord, [are] God, merciful and gracious, \qac ǁ\qac* Slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth.
\v 16 Look to me, and favor me, \qac ǁ\qac* Give Your strength to Your servant, \qac ǁ\qac* And give salvation to a son of Your handmaid.

\v 2 My prayer comes in before You, \qac ǁ\qac* Incline Your ear to my loud cry,
\v 3 For my soul has been full of evils, \qac ǁ\qac* And my life has come to Sheol.
\v 4 I have been reckoned with those going down [to] the pit, \qac ǁ\qac* I have been as a man without strength.
\v 5 Among the dead—free, \qac ǁ\qac* As pierced ones lying in the grave, \qac ǁ\qac* Whom You have not remembered anymore, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, they have been cut off by Your hand.
\v 6 You have put me in the lowest pit, \qac ǁ\qac* In dark places, in depths.
\v 7 Your fury has lain on me, \qac ǁ\qac* And You have afflicted [with] all Your breakers. Selah.
\v 8 You have put my acquaintance far from me, \qac ǁ\qac* You have made me an abomination to them, \qac ǁ\qac* Shut up—I do not go forth.
\v 9 My eye has grieved because of affliction, \qac ǁ\qac* I called You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, all the day, \qac ǁ\qac* I have spread out my hands to You.
\v 10 Do You do wonders to the dead? Does Rephaim rise? Do they thank You? Selah.
\v 11 Is Your kindness recounted in the grave? Your faithfulness in destruction?
\v 12 Are Your wonders known in the darkness? And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
\v 13 And I, to You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, I have cried, \qac ǁ\qac* And in the morning my prayer comes before You.
\v 14 Why, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, do You cast off my soul? You hide Your face from me.
\v 15 I [am] afflicted, and expiring from youth, \qac ǁ\qac* I have borne Your terrors—I pine away.
\v 16 Your wrath has passed over me, \qac ǁ\qac* Your terrors have cut me off,
\v 17 They have surrounded me as waters all the day, \qac ǁ\qac* They have gone around against me together,

\v 1 Of the kind acts of \nd Yhwh\nd*, I sing for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* From generation to generation I make known Your faithfulness with my mouth,
\v 2 For I said, “Kindness is built for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* The heavens! You establish Your faithfulness in them.”
\v 3 I have made a covenant for My chosen, \qac ǁ\qac* I have sworn to My servant David:
\v 4 “Even for all time I establish your seed, \qac ǁ\qac* And have built your throne to generation and generation.” Selah.
\v 5 And the heavens confess Your wonders, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Your faithfulness [is] also in an assembly of holy ones.
\v 6 For who in the sky, compares himself to \nd Yhwh\nd*? [Who] is like to \nd Yhwh\nd* among sons of the mighty?
\v 7 God is very terrible, \qac ǁ\qac* In the secret counsel of His holy ones, \qac ǁ\qac* And fearful over all surrounding Him.
\v 8 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, God of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* Who [is] like You—a strong \nd Yah\nd*? And Your faithfulness [is] around You.
\v 9 You [are] ruler over the pride of the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* In the lifting up of its billows You restrain them.
\v 10 You have bruised Rahab, as one wounded. You have scattered Your enemies with the arm of Your strength.
\v 11 The heavens [are] Yours, \qac ǁ\qac* The earth [is] also Yours, \qac ǁ\qac* The habitable world and its fullness, \qac ǁ\qac* You have founded them.
\v 12 North and south You have appointed them, \qac ǁ\qac* Tabor and Hermon sing in Your Name.
\v 13 You have an arm with might, \qac ǁ\qac* Strong is Your hand—high Your right hand.
\v 14 Righteousness and judgment \qac ǁ\qac* [Are] the fixed place of Your throne, \qac ǁ\qac* Kindness and truth go before Your face.
\v 15 O the blessedness of the people knowing the shout, \qac ǁ\qac* O \nd Yhwh\nd*, they habitually walk in the light of Your face.
\v 16 They rejoice in Your Name all the day, \qac ǁ\qac* And they are exalted in Your righteousness,
\v 17 For You [are] the beauty of their strength, \qac ǁ\qac* And in Your good will is our horn exalted,
\v 18 For our shield [is] of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And our king to the Holy One of Israel.
\v 19 Then You have spoken in vision, \qac ǁ\qac* To Your saint, indeed, \qac ǁ\qac* You say, I have placed help on a mighty one, \qac ǁ\qac* Exalted a chosen one out of the people,
\v 20 I have found My servant David, \qac ǁ\qac* With My holy oil I have anointed him.
\v 21 With whom My hand is established, \qac ǁ\qac* My arm also strengthens him.
\v 22 An enemy does not exact on him, \qac ǁ\qac* And a son of perverseness does not afflict him.
\v 23 And I have beaten down his adversaries before him, \qac ǁ\qac* And I plague those hating him,
\v 24 And My faithfulness and kindness [are] with him, \qac ǁ\qac* And in My Name is his horn exalted.
\v 25 And I have set his hand on the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* And his right hand on the rivers.
\v 26 He proclaims to Me: “You [are] my Father, \qac ǁ\qac* My God, and the rock of my salvation.”
\v 27 I also appoint him firstborn, \qac ǁ\qac* Highest of the kings of the earth.
\v 28 For all time I keep for him My kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* And My covenant [is] steadfast with him.
\v 29 And I have set his seed forever, \qac ǁ\qac* And his throne as the days of the heavens.
\v 30 If his sons forsake My law, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not walk in My judgments;
\v 31 If they defile My statutes, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not keep My commands,
\v 32 I have looked after their transgression with a rod, \qac ǁ\qac* And their iniquity with strokes,
\v 33 And I do not break My kindness from him, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor do I deal falsely in My faithfulness.
\v 34 I do not profane My covenant, \qac ǁ\qac* And I do not change that which is going forth from My lips.
\v 35 Once I have sworn by My holiness, \qac ǁ\qac* I do not lie to David,
\v 36 His seed is for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* And his throne [is] as the sun before Me,
\v 37 It is established as the moon for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* And the witness in the sky is steadfast. Selah.
\v 38 And You, You have cast off, and reject, \qac ǁ\qac* You have shown Yourself angry with Your anointed,
\v 39 Have rejected the covenant of Your servant, \qac ǁ\qac* You have defiled his crown to the earth,
\v 40 You have broken down all his hedges, \qac ǁ\qac* You have made his fortifications a ruin.
\v 41 Everyone passing by the way has spoiled him, \qac ǁ\qac* He has been a reproach to his neighbors,
\v 42 You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries, \qac ǁ\qac* You have caused all his enemies to rejoice.
\v 43 Also—You turn back the sharpness of his sword, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not established him in battle,
\v 44 Have caused [him] to cease from his brightness, \qac ǁ\qac* And have cast down his throne to the earth.
\v 45 You have shortened the days of his youth, \qac ǁ\qac* Have covered him over [with] shame. Selah.
\v 46 Until when, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, are You hidden? Does Your fury burn as fire forever?
\v 47 Remember how [short] my lifetime [is]. Why have You created in vain \qac ǁ\qac* All the sons of men?
\v 48 Who [is] the man that lives, and does not see death? He delivers his soul from the hand of Sheol. Selah.
\v 49 Where [are] Your former kindnesses, O Lord, \qac ǁ\qac* [Which] You have sworn to David in Your faithfulness?
\v 50 Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants, \qac ǁ\qac* I have borne in my bosom all the strivings of the peoples,
\v 51 With which Your enemies reproached, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* With which they have reproached \qac ǁ\qac* The steps of Your anointed.

\v 10 Forty years I am weary of the generation, \qac ǁ\qac* And I say, “A people erring in heart—they! And they have not known My ways”:

\v 1 I sing kindness and judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* To You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, I sing praise.
\v 2 I act wisely in a perfect way, \qac ǁ\qac* When do You come to me? I habitually walk in the integrity of my heart, \qac ǁ\qac* In the midst of my house.
\v 3 I do not set a worthless thing before my eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* I have hated the work of those turning aside, \qac ǁ\qac* It does not adhere to me.
\v 4 A perverse heart turns aside from me, \qac ǁ\qac* I do not know wickedness.
\v 5 Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, \qac ǁ\qac* Him I cut off, \qac ǁ\qac* The high of eyes and proud of heart, \qac ǁ\qac* Him I do not endure.
\v 6 My eyes are on the faithful of the land, \qac ǁ\qac* To dwell with me, \qac ǁ\qac* Whoever is walking in a perfect way, he serves me.
\v 7 He who is working deceit does not dwell in my house, \qac ǁ\qac* Whoever is speaking lies is not established before my eyes.
\v 8 At morning I cut off all the wicked of the land, \qac ǁ\qac* To cut off from the city of \nd Yhwh\nd* \qac ǁ\qac* All the workers of iniquity!
\c 102
\d A Prayer of the afflicted when he is feeble, and pours out his complaint before YHWH.
\p
\v 1 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, hear my prayer, indeed, my cry comes to You.
\v 2 Do not hide Your face from me, \qac ǁ\qac* In a day of my adversity, \qac ǁ\qac* Incline Your ear to me, \qac ǁ\qac* In the day I call, hurry, answer me.
\v 3 For my days have been consumed in smoke, \qac ǁ\qac* And my bones have burned as a firebrand.
\v 4 Struck as the herb, and withered, is my heart, \qac ǁ\qac* For I have forgotten to eat my bread.
\v 5 From the voice of my sighing \qac ǁ\qac* My bone has cleaved to my flesh.
\v 6 I have been like to a pelican of the wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* I have been as an owl of the dry places.
\v 7 I have watched, and I am \qac ǁ\qac* As a bird alone on the roof.
\v 8 All the day my enemies reproached me, \qac ǁ\qac* Those mad at me have sworn against me.
\v 9 Because I have eaten ashes as bread, \qac ǁ\qac* And have mingled my drink with weeping,
\v 10 From Your indignation and Your wrath, \qac ǁ\qac* For You have lifted me up, \qac ǁ\qac* And cast me down.
\v 11 My days [are] stretched out as a shadow, \qac ǁ\qac* And I am withered as the herb.
\v 12 And You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, abide for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* And Your memorial from generation to generation.
\v 13 You rise—You pity Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* For the time to favor her, \qac ǁ\qac* For the appointed time has come.
\v 14 For Your servants have been pleased with her stones, \qac ǁ\qac* And they favor her dust.
\v 15 And nations fear the Name of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And all kings of the earth Your glory,
\v 16 For \nd Yhwh\nd* has built Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* He has been seen in His glory,
\v 17 He turned to the prayer of the destitute, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has not despised their prayer.
\v 18 This is written for a later generation, \qac ǁ\qac* And the people created praise \nd Yah\nd*.
\v 19 For He has looked \qac ǁ\qac* From the high place of His sanctuary. \nd Yhwh\nd* looked attentively from the heavens to earth,
\v 20 To hear the groan of the prisoner, \qac ǁ\qac* To loose sons of death,
\v 21 To declare in Zion the Name of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And His praise in Jerusalem,
\v 22 In the peoples being gathered together, \qac ǁ\qac* And the kingdoms—to serve \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 23 He has humbled my power in the way, \qac ǁ\qac* He has shortened my days.
\v 24 I say, “My God, do not take me up in the midst of my days,” \qac ǁ\qac* Your years [are] through all generations.
\v 25 You founded the earth before time, \qac ǁ\qac* And the heavens [are] the work of Your hands.
\v 26 They perish, and You remain, \qac ǁ\qac* And all of them become old as a garment, \qac ǁ\qac* You change them as clothing, \qac ǁ\qac* And they are changed.
\v 27 And You [are] the same, and Your years are not finished.
\v 28 The sons of Your servants continue, \qac ǁ\qac* And their seed is established before You!

\v 11 For as the height of the heavens [is] above the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* His kindness has been mighty over those fearing Him.
\v 12 He has put our transgressions far from us—as the distance of east from west.
\v 13 As a father has mercy on sons, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* has mercy on those fearing Him.
\v 14 For He has known our frame, \qac ǁ\qac* Remembering that we [are] dust.
\v 15 Mortal man! His days [are] as grass, \qac ǁ\qac* He flourishes as a flower of the field;
\v 16 For a wind has passed over it, and it is not, \qac ǁ\qac* And its place does not discern it anymore.
\v 17 And the kindness of \nd Yhwh\nd* \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] from age even to age on those fearing Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And His righteousness to sons’ sons,

\v 2 Covering Himself [with] light as a garment, \qac ǁ\qac* Stretching out the heavens as a curtain,
\v 3 Who is laying the beam of His upper chambers in the waters, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is making thick clouds His chariot, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is walking on wings of wind,
\v 4 Making His messengers—the winds, \qac ǁ\qac* His ministers—the flaming fire.
\v 5 He has founded earth on its bases, \qac ǁ\qac* It is not moved for all time and forever.
\v 6 The abyss! You have covered it as with clothing, \qac ǁ\qac* Waters stand above hills.
\v 7 They flee from Your rebuke, \qac ǁ\qac* They hurry away from the voice of Your thunder.
\v 8 They go up hills—they go down valleys, \qac ǁ\qac* To a place You have founded for them.
\v 9 You have set a border, they do not pass over, \qac ǁ\qac* They do not turn back to cover the earth.
\v 10 He is sending forth fountains in valleys, \qac ǁ\qac* They go on between hills.
\v 11 They water every beast of the field, \qac ǁ\qac* Wild donkeys break their thirst.
\v 12 The bird of the heavens dwells by them, \qac ǁ\qac* From between the branches \qac ǁ\qac* They give forth the voice.
\v 13 Watering hills from His upper chambers, \qac ǁ\qac* The earth is satisfied from the fruit of Your works.
\v 14 Causing grass to spring up for livestock, \qac ǁ\qac* And herb for the service of man, \qac ǁ\qac* To bring forth bread from the earth,
\v 15 And wine—it makes the heart of man glad, \qac ǁ\qac* To cause the face to shine from oil, \qac ǁ\qac* And bread—it supports the heart of man.
\v 16 The trees of \nd Yhwh\nd* [are] satisfied, \qac ǁ\qac* Cedars of Lebanon that He has planted,
\v 17 Where birds make nests, \qac ǁ\qac* The stork—the firs [are] her house.
\v 18 The high hills [are] for wild goats, rocks [are] a refuge for hyraxes,
\v 19 He made the moon for seasons, \qac ǁ\qac* The sun has known his place of entrance.
\v 20 You set darkness, and it is night, \qac ǁ\qac* Every beast of the forest creeps in it.
\v 21 The young lions are roaring for prey, \qac ǁ\qac* And to seek their food from God.
\v 22 The sun rises, they are gathered, \qac ǁ\qac* And they crouch in their dens.
\v 23 Man goes forth to his work, \qac ǁ\qac* And to his service—until evening.
\v 24 How many have been Your works, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* You have made all of them in wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* The earth is full of your possessions.

\v 23 And Israel comes into Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And Jacob has sojourned in the land of Ham.
\v 24 And He makes His people very fruitful, \qac ǁ\qac* And makes it mightier than its adversaries.
\v 25 He turned their heart to hate His people, \qac ǁ\qac* To conspire against His servants.
\v 26 He has sent His servant Moses, \qac ǁ\qac* Aaron whom He had fixed on.
\v 27 They have set among them the matters of His signs, \qac ǁ\qac* And wonders in the land of Ham.
\v 28 He has sent darkness, and it is dark, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have not provoked His word.

\v 33 And He strikes their vine and their fig, \qac ǁ\qac* And shatters the trees of their border.
\v 34 He has commanded, and the locust comes, \qac ǁ\qac* And the cankerworm—innumerable,
\v 35 And it consumes every herb in their land, \qac ǁ\qac* And it consumes the fruit of their ground.
\v 36 And He strikes every firstborn in their land, \qac ǁ\qac* The first-fruit of all their strength,
\v 37 And brings them out with silver and gold, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is not a feeble one in its tribes.
\v 38 Egypt has rejoiced in their going forth, \qac ǁ\qac* For their fear had fallen on them.
\v 39 He has spread a cloud for a covering, \qac ǁ\qac* And fire to enlighten the night.

\v 16 And they are envious of Moses in the camp, \qac ǁ\qac* Of Aaron, \nd Yhwh\nd*’s holy one.
\v 17 Earth opens, and swallows up Dathan, \qac ǁ\qac* And covers over the company of Abiram.
\v 18 And fire burns among their company, \qac ǁ\qac* A flame sets the wicked on fire.
\v 19 They make a calf in Horeb, \qac ǁ\qac* And bow themselves to a molten image,
\v 20 And change their glory \qac ǁ\qac* Into the form of an ox eating herbs.
\v 21 They have forgotten God their Savior, \qac ǁ\qac* The doer of great things in Egypt,
\v 22 Of wonderful things in the land of Ham, \qac ǁ\qac* Of fearful things by the Sea of Suph.
\v 23 And He commands to destroy them, \qac ǁ\qac* Unless Moses, His chosen one, \qac ǁ\qac* Had stood in the breach before Him, \qac ǁ\qac* To turn back His wrath from destroying.
\v 24 And they kick against the desirable land, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not given credence to His word.
\v 25 And they murmur in their tents, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not listened to the voice of \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 26 And He lifts up His hand to them, \qac ǁ\qac* To cause them to fall in a wilderness,
\v 27 And to cause their seed to fall among nations, \qac ǁ\qac* And to scatter them through lands.
\v 28 And they are coupled to Ba‘al-Peor, \qac ǁ\qac* And eat the sacrifices of the dead,
\v 29 And they provoke to anger by their actions, \qac ǁ\qac* And a plague breaks forth on them,
\v 30 And Phinehas stands, and executes judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* And the plague is restrained,
\v 31 And it is reckoned to him for righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* From generation to generation—for all time.
\v 32 And they cause wrath by the waters of Meribah, \qac ǁ\qac* And it is evil to Moses for their sakes,
\v 33 For they have provoked his spirit, \qac ǁ\qac* And he speaks wrongfully with his lips.
\v 34 They have not destroyed the peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* As \nd Yhwh\nd* had commanded to them,
\v 35 And mix themselves among nations, and learn their works,
\v 36 And serve their idols, \qac ǁ\qac* And they are for a snare to them.
\v 37 And they sacrifice their sons and their daughters to the demons,
\v 38 And they shed innocent blood—Blood of their sons and of their daughters, \qac ǁ\qac* Whom they have sacrificed to idols of Canaan, \qac ǁ\qac* And the land is profaned with blood.
\v 39 And they are defiled with their works, \qac ǁ\qac* And commit whoredom in their habitual doings.
\v 40 And the anger of \nd Yhwh\nd* \qac ǁ\qac* Is kindled against His people, \qac ǁ\qac* And He detests His inheritance.
\v 41 And gives them into the hand of nations, \qac ǁ\qac* And those hating them rule over them,
\v 42 And their enemies oppress them, \qac ǁ\qac* And they are humbled under their hand.
\v 43 He delivers them many times, \qac ǁ\qac* And they rebel in their counsel, \qac ǁ\qac* And they are brought low in their iniquity.
\v 44 And He looks on their distress \qac ǁ\qac* When He hears their cry,
\v 45 And remembers His covenant for them, \qac ǁ\qac* And is comforted, \qac ǁ\qac* According to the abundance of His kindness.
\v 46 And He appoints them for mercies \qac ǁ\qac* Before all their captors.
\v 47 Save us, O our God \nd Yhwh\nd*, and gather us from the nations, \qac ǁ\qac* To give thanks to Your Holy Name, \qac ǁ\qac* To glory in Your praise.
\v 48 Blessed [is] \nd Yhwh\nd*, God of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* From age until age. And all the people said, “Amen, praise \nd Yah\nd*!”

\v 1 “Give thanks to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* For [He is] good, for His kindness [is] for all time”:
\v 2 Let the redeemed of \nd Yhwh\nd* say [so], \qac ǁ\qac* Whom He redeemed from the hand of an adversary.
\v 3 And has gathered them from the lands, \qac ǁ\qac* From east and from west, \qac ǁ\qac* From north, and from the sea.
\v 4 They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert by the way, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not found a city of habitation.
\v 5 Hungry—indeed—thirsty, \qac ǁ\qac* Their soul becomes feeble in them,
\v 6 And they cry to \nd Yhwh\nd* in their adversity, \qac ǁ\qac* He delivers them from their distress,
\v 7 And causes them to tread in a right way, \qac ǁ\qac* To go to a city of habitation.
\v 8 They confess to \nd Yhwh\nd* His kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* And His wonders to the sons of men.
\v 9 For He has satisfied a longing soul, \qac ǁ\qac* And has filled a hungry soul [with] goodness.
\v 10 Inhabitants of dark places and death-shade, \qac ǁ\qac* Prisoners of affliction and of iron,
\v 11 Because they changed the saying of God, \qac ǁ\qac* And despised the counsel of the Most High.
\v 12 And He humbles their heart with labor, \qac ǁ\qac* They have been feeble, and there is no helper.
\v 13 And they cry to \nd Yhwh\nd* in their adversity, \qac ǁ\qac* He saves them from their distresses.
\v 14 He brings them out from the dark place, \qac ǁ\qac* And death-shade, \qac ǁ\qac* And He draws away their bands.
\v 15 They confess to \nd Yhwh\nd* His kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* And His wonders to the sons of men.
\v 16 For He has broken doors of bronze, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has cut bars of iron.
\v 17 Fools, by means of their transgression, \qac ǁ\qac* And by their iniquities, afflict themselves.
\v 18 Their soul detests all food, \qac ǁ\qac* And they come near to the gates of death,
\v 19 And cry to \nd Yhwh\nd* in their adversity, \qac ǁ\qac* He saves them from their distresses,
\v 20 He sends His word and heals them, \qac ǁ\qac* And delivers [them] from their destructions.
\v 21 They confess to \nd Yhwh\nd* His kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* And His wonders to the sons of men,
\v 22 And they sacrifice sacrifices of thanksgiving, \qac ǁ\qac* And recount His works with singing.
\v 23 Those going down [to] the sea in ships, \qac ǁ\qac* Doing business in many waters,
\v 24 They have seen the works of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And His wonders in the deep.
\v 25 And He commands, and appoints a storm, \qac ǁ\qac* And it lifts up its billows,
\v 26 They go up [to] the heavens, they go down [to] the depths, \qac ǁ\qac* Their soul is melted in evil.
\v 27 They reel to and fro, and move as a drunkard, \qac ǁ\qac* And all their wisdom is swallowed up.
\v 28 And they cry to \nd Yhwh\nd* in their adversity, \qac ǁ\qac* And He brings them out from their distresses.
\v 29 He calms a whirlwind, \qac ǁ\qac* And their billows are hushed.
\v 30 And they rejoice because they are quiet, \qac ǁ\qac* And He leads them to the haven of their desire.
\v 31 They confess to \nd Yhwh\nd* His kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* And His wonders to the sons of men,
\v 32 And they exalt Him in [the] assembly of [the] people, \qac ǁ\qac* And praise Him in [the] seat of [the] elderly.
\v 33 He makes rivers become a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* And fountains of waters become dry land.
\v 34 A fruitful land becomes a barren place, \qac ǁ\qac* For the wickedness of its inhabitants.
\v 35 He makes a wilderness become a pool of water, \qac ǁ\qac* And a dry land become fountains of waters.
\v 36 And He causes the hungry to dwell there, \qac ǁ\qac* And they prepare a city of habitation.
\v 37 And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, \qac ǁ\qac* And they make fruits of increase.
\v 38 And He blesses them, and they multiply exceedingly, \qac ǁ\qac* And He does not diminish their livestock.
\v 39 And they are diminished, and bow down, \qac ǁ\qac* By restraint, evil, and sorrow.
\v 40 He is pouring contempt on nobles, \qac ǁ\qac* And causes them to wander in vacancy—no way.
\v 41 And sets the needy on high from affliction, \qac ǁ\qac* And places families as a flock.
\v 42 The upright see and rejoice, \qac ǁ\qac* And all perversity has shut her mouth.
\v 43 Who [is] wise, and observes these? They understand the kind acts of \nd Yhwh\nd*!

\v 1 My heart is prepared, O God, \qac ǁ\qac* I sing, indeed, I sing praise, also my glory.
\v 2 Awake, stringed instrument and harp, \qac ǁ\qac* I awake the dawn.
\v 3 I thank You among peoples, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And I praise You among the nations.
\v 4 For Your kindness [is] great above the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* And Your truth to the clouds.
\v 5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God, \qac ǁ\qac* And Your glory above all the earth.
\v 6 That Your beloved ones may be delivered, \qac ǁ\qac* Save [with] Your right hand, and answer us.
\v 7 God has spoken in His holiness: I exult, I apportion Shechem, \qac ǁ\qac* And I measure the Valley of Succoth,
\v 8 Gilead [is] Mine, Manasseh [is] Mine, \qac ǁ\qac* And Ephraim [is] the strength of My head, \qac ǁ\qac* Judah [is] My lawgiver,
\v 9 Moab [is] a pot for My washing, \qac ǁ\qac* On Edom I cast My shoe, \qac ǁ\qac* Over Philistia I habitually shout.
\v 10 Who brings me [into] the fortified city? Who has led me to Edom?
\v 11 Have You not, O God, cast us off? And You do not go out, O God, with our hosts!
\v 12 Give to us help from adversity, \qac ǁ\qac* And the salvation of man is vain.
\v 13 We do mightily in God, \qac ǁ\qac* And He treads down our adversaries!

\d To the Overseer. A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 O God of my praise, do not be silent,
\v 2 For the mouth of wickedness, and the mouth of deceit, \qac ǁ\qac* They have opened against me, \qac ǁ\qac* They have spoken with me—A tongue of falsehood, and words of hatred!
\v 3 They have surrounded me about, \qac ǁ\qac* And they fight me without cause.
\v 4 For my love they oppose me, and I—prayer!
\v 5 And they set against me evil for good, \qac ǁ\qac* And hatred for my love.
\v 6 Appoint the wicked over him, \qac ǁ\qac* And an adversary stands at his right hand.
\v 7 In his being judged, he goes forth wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* And his prayer is for sin.
\v 8 His days are few, another takes his oversight,
\v 9 His sons are fatherless, and his wife a widow.
\v 10 And his sons wander continually, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, they have begged, \qac ǁ\qac* And have sought out of their dry places.
\v 11 An exactor lays a snare for all that he has, \qac ǁ\qac* And strangers spoil his labor.
\v 12 He has none to extend kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor is there one showing favor to his orphans.
\v 13 His posterity is for cutting off, \qac ǁ\qac* Their name is blotted out in another generation.
\v 14 The iniquity of his fathers \qac ǁ\qac* Is remembered to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And the sin of his mother is not blotted out.
\v 15 They are continually before \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And He cuts off their memorial from earth.
\v 16 Because that he has not remembered to do kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* And pursues the poor man and needy, \qac ǁ\qac* And the struck of heart—to slay,
\v 17 And he loves reviling, and it meets him, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has not delighted in blessing, \qac ǁ\qac* And it is far from him.
\v 18 And he puts on reviling as his robe, \qac ǁ\qac* And it comes in as water into his midst, \qac ǁ\qac* And as oil into his bones.
\v 19 It is to him as apparel—he covers himself, \qac ǁ\qac* And he girds it on for a continual girdle.
\v 20 This [is] the wage of my accusers from \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And of those speaking evil against my soul.
\v 21 And You, O Lord \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Deal with me for Your Name’s sake, \qac ǁ\qac* Because Your kindness [is] good, deliver me.
\v 22 For I [am] poor and needy, \qac ǁ\qac* And my heart has been pierced in my midst.
\v 23 I have gone as a shadow when it is stretched out, \qac ǁ\qac* I have been driven away as a locust.
\v 24 My knees have been feeble from fasting, \qac ǁ\qac* And my flesh has failed of fatness.
\v 25 And I have been a reproach to them, \qac ǁ\qac* They see me, they shake their head.
\v 26 Help me, O \nd Yhwh\nd* my God, \qac ǁ\qac* Save me, according to Your kindness.
\v 27 And they know that this [is] Your hand, \qac ǁ\qac* You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, You have done it.
\v 28 They revile, and You bless, \qac ǁ\qac* They have risen, and are ashamed, \qac ǁ\qac* And Your servant rejoices.
\v 29 My accusers put on blushing, and are covered, \qac ǁ\qac* Their shame [is] as an upper robe.
\v 30 I thank \nd Yhwh\nd* greatly with my mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* And I praise Him in the midst of many,
\v 31 For He stands at the right hand of the needy, \qac ǁ\qac* To save from those judging his soul.

\v 3 Your people [are] free-will gifts in the day of Your strength, in the honors of holiness, \qac ǁ\qac* From the womb, from the morning, \qac ǁ\qac* You have the dew of Your youth.
\v 4 \nd Yhwh\nd* has sworn, and does not relent, “You [are] a priest for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* According to the order of Melchizedek.”
\v 5 The Lord on Your right hand struck kings \qac ǁ\qac* In the day of His anger.
\v 6 He judges among the nations, \qac ǁ\qac* He has completed the carcasses, \qac ǁ\qac* Has struck the head over the mighty earth.
\v 7 He drinks from a brook in the way, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore He lifts up the head!

\v 4 He has made a memorial of His wonders, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] gracious and merciful.
\v 5 He has given prey to those fearing Him, \qac ǁ\qac* He remembers His covenant for all time.
\v 6 He has declared the power of His works to His people, \qac ǁ\qac* To give to them the inheritance of nations.
\v 7 The works of His hands [are] true and just, \qac ǁ\qac* All His appointments [are] steadfast.
\v 8 They are sustained forever and for all time. They are made in truth and uprightness.
\v 9 He has sent redemption to His people, \qac ǁ\qac* He has appointed His covenant for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* His Name [is] holy and fearful.
\v 10 The fear of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] the beginning of wisdom, \qac ǁ\qac* Good understanding have all doing them, \qac ǁ\qac* His praise [is] standing forever!

\v 3 Wealth and riches [are] in his house, \qac ǁ\qac* And his righteousness is standing forever.
\v 4 Light has risen in darkness to the upright, \qac ǁ\qac* Gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
\v 5 The man—good, gracious, and lending, \qac ǁ\qac* He sustains his matters in judgment.
\v 6 For he is not moved for all time; For the righteous is a continuous memorial.
\v 7 He is not afraid of an evil report, \qac ǁ\qac* His heart is prepared [and] confident in \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 8 His heart is sustained—he does not fear, \qac ǁ\qac* Until he looks on his adversaries.
\v 9 He has scattered—has given to the needy, \qac ǁ\qac* His righteousness is standing forever, \qac ǁ\qac* His horn is exalted with glory.

\v 4 Their idols [are] silver and gold, work of man’s hands,

\v 6 I have spread forth my hands to You, \qac ǁ\qac* My soul [is] as a weary land for You. Selah.
\v 7 Hurry, answer me, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* My spirit has been consumed, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not hide Your face from me, \qac ǁ\qac* Or I have been compared with those going down [to] the pit.
\v 8 Cause me to hear Your kindness in the morning, \qac ǁ\qac* For I have trusted in You, \qac ǁ\qac* Cause me to know the way that I go, \qac ǁ\qac* For I have lifted up my soul to You.
\v 9 Deliver me from my enemies, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Near You I am covered.
\v 10 Teach me to do Your good pleasure, \qac ǁ\qac* For You [are] my God—Your Spirit [is] good, \qac ǁ\qac* Lead me into a land of uprightness.
\v 11 You quicken me for Your Name’s sake, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* In Your righteousness, You bring out my soul from distress,
\v 12 And in Your kindness cut off my enemies, \qac ǁ\qac* And have destroyed all the adversaries of my soul, \qac ǁ\qac* For I [am] Your servant!

\v 1 Blessed [is] \nd Yhwh\nd* my Rock, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is teaching My hands for war, \qac ǁ\qac* My fingers for battle.
\v 2 My kind one, and my bulwark, \qac ǁ\qac* My tower, and my deliverer, \qac ǁ\qac* My shield, and in whom I have trusted, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is subduing my people under me!
\v 3 \nd Yhwh\nd*, what [is] man that You know him? The son of man, that You esteem him?
\v 4 Man has been like a breath, \qac ǁ\qac* His days [are] as a shadow passing by.
\v 5 \nd Yhwh\nd*, incline Your heavens and come down, \qac ǁ\qac* Strike against mountains, and they smoke.
\v 6 Send forth lightning, and scatter them, \qac ǁ\qac* Send forth Your arrows, and trouble them,
\v 7 Send forth Your hand from on high, \qac ǁ\qac* Free me, and deliver me from many waters, \qac ǁ\qac* From the hand of sons of a stranger,
\v 8 Because their mouth has spoken vanity, \qac ǁ\qac* And their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood.
\v 9 O God, I sing to You a new song, \qac ǁ\qac* I sing praise to You on a stringed instrument of ten strings.
\v 10 Who is giving deliverance to kings, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is freeing His servant David from the sword of evil.
\v 11 Free me, and deliver me \qac ǁ\qac* From the hand of sons of a stranger, \qac ǁ\qac* Because their mouth has spoken vanity, \qac ǁ\qac* And their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood,
\v 12 Because our sons [are] as plants, \qac ǁ\qac* Becoming great in their youth, \qac ǁ\qac* Our daughters as hewn stones, \qac ǁ\qac* Polished—the likeness of a palace,
\v 13 Our granaries [are] full, bringing out from kind to kind, \qac ǁ\qac* Our flocks are bringing forth thousands, \qac ǁ\qac* Ten thousands in our out-places,
\v 14 Our oxen are carrying, there is no breach, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is no outgoing, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is no crying in our broad places.
\v 15 O the blessedness of the people that is thus, \qac ǁ\qac* O the blessedness of the people whose God [is] \nd Yhwh\nd*!
