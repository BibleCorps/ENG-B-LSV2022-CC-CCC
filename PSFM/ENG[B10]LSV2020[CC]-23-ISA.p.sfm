\v 1 The visions of Isaiah son of Amoz, that he has seen concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
\v 2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* has spoken: “I have nourished and brought up sons, \qac ǁ\qac* And they transgressed against Me.
\v 3 An ox has known its owner, \qac ǁ\qac* And a donkey the crib of its master, \qac ǁ\qac* Israel has not known, \qac ǁ\qac* My people have not understood.”
\v 4 Oh, sinning nation, a people heavy [with] iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* A seed of evildoers, sons—corrupters! They have forsaken \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* They have despised the Holy One of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* They have gone away backward.
\v 5 Why are you struck anymore? You add apostasy! Every head has become diseased, and every heart [is] sick.
\v 6 From the sole of the foot—to the head, \qac ǁ\qac* There is no soundness in it, \qac ǁ\qac* Wound, and bruise, and fresh striking! They have not been closed nor bound, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor have they softened with ointment.
\v 7 Your land [is] a desolation, your cities burned with fire, \qac ǁ\qac* Your ground—strangers are consuming it before you, \qac ǁ\qac* And a desolation as overthrown by strangers!
\v 8 And the daughter of Zion has been left, \qac ǁ\qac* As a shelter in a vineyard, \qac ǁ\qac* As a lodge in a place of cucumbers—as a city besieged.
\v 9 Unless \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts had left a remnant to us, \qac ǁ\qac* Shortly—we had been as Sodom, \qac ǁ\qac* We had been like to Gomorrah!
\v 10 Hear the word of \nd Yhwh\nd*, you rulers of Sodom, \qac ǁ\qac* Give ear to the Law of our God, you people of Gomorrah,
\v 11 “Why the abundance of your sacrifices to Me?” says \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* “I have been satiated [with] burnt-offerings of rams, \qac ǁ\qac* And fat of fatlings; And blood of bullocks, and lambs, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have not desired male goats.
\v 12 When you come to appear before Me, \qac ǁ\qac* Who has required this of your hand, \qac ǁ\qac* To trample My courts?
\v 13 Do not add to bring in a vain present, \qac ǁ\qac* Incense—it [is] an abomination to Me, \qac ǁ\qac* New moon, and Sabbath, calling of convocation! Do not render iniquity—and a restraint!
\v 14 My soul has hated your new moons and your set seasons, \qac ǁ\qac* They have been on Me for a burden, \qac ǁ\qac* I have been weary of bearing.
\v 15 And in your spreading forth your hands, I hide My eyes from you, \qac ǁ\qac* Also when you increase prayer, I do not hear, \qac ǁ\qac* Your hands have been full of blood.
\v 16 Wash yourselves, make yourselves pure, \qac ǁ\qac* Turn aside the evil of your doings, from before My eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* Cease to do evil, learn to do good.
\v 17 Seek judgment, make the oppressed blessed, \qac ǁ\qac* Judge the fatherless, strive [for] the widow.
\v 18 Now come, and we settle this,” says \nd Yhwh\nd*, “If your sins are as scarlet, they will be white as snow, \qac ǁ\qac* If they are red as crimson, they will be as wool!
\v 19 If you are willing, and have listened, \qac ǁ\qac* The good of the land you consume,
\v 20 And if you refuse, and have rebelled, \qac ǁ\qac* You are consumed [by] the sword,” \qac ǁ\qac* For the mouth of \nd Yhwh\nd* has spoken.
\v 21 How has a faithful city become a harlot? I have filled it [with] judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* Righteousness lodges in it—now murderers.
\v 22 Your silver has become dross, \qac ǁ\qac* Your drink defiled with water.
\v 23 Your princes [are] apostates, and companions of thieves, \qac ǁ\qac* Everyone loving a bribe, and pursuing rewards, \qac ǁ\qac* They do not judge the fatherless, \qac ǁ\qac* And the plea of the widow does not come to them.
\v 24 Therefore—a declaration of the Lord—\nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: “Oh, I relieve Myself from My adversaries, \qac ǁ\qac* And avenge Myself against My enemies,
\v 25 And I turn back My hand on you, \qac ǁ\qac* And I refine your dross as purity, \qac ǁ\qac* And I turn aside all your tin,
\v 26 And I give back your judges as at the first, \qac ǁ\qac* And your counselors as in the beginning, \qac ǁ\qac* After this you are called, A city of righteousness—a faithful city.”
\v 27 Zion is redeemed in judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* And her captivity in righteousness.
\v 28 And the destruction of transgressors and sinners [is] together, \qac ǁ\qac* And those forsaking \nd Yhwh\nd* are consumed.
\v 29 For [men] are ashamed because of the oaks \qac ǁ\qac* That you have desired, \qac ǁ\qac* And you are confounded because of the gardens \qac ǁ\qac* That you have chosen.
\v 30 For you are as an oak whose leaf is fading, \qac ǁ\qac* And as a garden that has no water.
\v 31 And the strong has been for tow, \qac ǁ\qac* And his work for a spark, \qac ǁ\qac* And both of them have burned together, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is none quenching!

\v 1 The thing that Isaiah son of Amoz has seen concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
\v 2 And it has come to pass, \qac ǁ\qac* In the latter end of the days, \qac ǁ\qac* The mountain of \nd Yhwh\nd*’s house is established, \qac ǁ\qac* Above the top of the mountains, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been lifted up above the heights, \qac ǁ\qac* And all the nations have flowed to it.
\v 3 And many peoples have gone and said, “Come, and we go up to the mountain of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* To the house of the God of Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And He teaches us of His ways, \qac ǁ\qac* And we walk in His paths, \qac ǁ\qac* For a law goes forth from Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* And a word of \nd Yhwh\nd* from Jerusalem.
\v 4 And He has judged between the nations, \qac ǁ\qac* And has given a decision to many peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have beat their swords to plowshares, \qac ǁ\qac* And their spears to pruning-hooks, \qac ǁ\qac* Nation does not lift up sword to nation, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor do they learn anymore—war.
\v 5 O house of Jacob, come, \qac ǁ\qac* And we walk in the light of \nd Yhwh\nd*.”
\v 6 For You have left Your people, the house of Jacob. For they have been filled from the east, \qac ǁ\qac* And [are] sorcerers like the Philistines, \qac ǁ\qac* And strike hands with the children of strangers.
\v 7 And its land is full of silver and gold, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is no end to its treasures, \qac ǁ\qac* And its land is full of horses, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is no end to its chariots,
\v 8 And its land is full of idols, \qac ǁ\qac* It bows itself to the work of its hands, \qac ǁ\qac* To that which its fingers have made,
\v 9 And the low bows down, and the high is humbled, \qac ǁ\qac* And You do not accept them.
\v 10 Enter into a rock, and be hidden in dust, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of the fear of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And because of the honor of His excellence.
\v 11 The haughty eyes of man have been humbled, \qac ǁ\qac* And the loftiness of men has been bowed down, \qac ǁ\qac* And \nd Yhwh\nd* alone has been set on high in that day.
\v 12 For a day [is] to \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* For every proud and high one, \qac ǁ\qac* And for every lifted up and low one,
\v 13 And for all cedars of Lebanon, \qac ǁ\qac* The high and the exalted ones, \qac ǁ\qac* And for all oaks of Bashan,
\v 14 And for all the high mountains, \qac ǁ\qac* And for all the exalted heights,
\v 15 And for every high tower, \qac ǁ\qac* And for every fortified wall,
\v 16 And for all ships of Tarshish, \qac ǁ\qac* And for all desirable pictures.
\v 17 And the haughtiness of man has been bowed down, \qac ǁ\qac* And the loftiness of men humbled, \qac ǁ\qac* And \nd Yhwh\nd* alone has been set on high in that day.
\v 18 And the idols—they completely pass away.
\v 19 And [men] have entered into caverns of rocks, \qac ǁ\qac* And into caves of dust, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of the fear of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And because of the honor of His excellence, \qac ǁ\qac* In His rising to terrify the earth.
\v 20 In that day man casts his idols of silver, \qac ǁ\qac* And his idols of gold, \qac ǁ\qac* That they have made for him to worship, \qac ǁ\qac* To moles, and to bats,
\v 21 To enter into cavities of the rocks, \qac ǁ\qac* And into clefts of the high places, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of the fear of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And because of the honor of His excellence, \qac ǁ\qac* In His rising to terrify the earth.
\v 22 Cease yourselves from man, \qac ǁ\qac* Whose breath [is] in his nostrils, \qac ǁ\qac* For—in what is he esteemed?
\c 3
\p
\v 1 For behold, the Lord, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* Is turning aside from Jerusalem and from Judah \qac ǁ\qac* [Both] stay and staff: Every stay of bread and every stay of water;
\v 2 Mighty and man of war, judge and prophet, \qac ǁ\qac* And diviner and elderly,
\v 3 Head of fifty, and accepted of faces, \qac ǁ\qac* And counselor, and wise craftsmen, \qac ǁ\qac* And discerning charmer.
\v 4 And I have made youths their heads, \qac ǁ\qac* And sucklings rule over them.
\v 5 And the people has exacted—man on man, \qac ǁ\qac* Even a man on his neighbor, \qac ǁ\qac* The youths enlarge themselves against the aged, \qac ǁ\qac* And the lightly esteemed against the honored.
\v 6 When one lays hold on his brother, \qac ǁ\qac* Of the house of his father, [by] the garment, “Come, you are a ruler to us, \qac ǁ\qac* And this ruin [is] under your hand.”
\v 7 He lifts up, in that day, saying, “I am not a binder up, \qac ǁ\qac* And in my house is neither bread nor garment, \qac ǁ\qac* You do not make me a ruler of the people.”
\v 8 For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen, \qac ǁ\qac* For their tongue and their doings [are] against \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* To provoke the eyes of His glory.
\v 9 The appearance of their faces witnessed against them, \qac ǁ\qac* And their sin, as Sodom, they declared, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not hidden! Woe to their soul, \qac ǁ\qac* For they have done evil to themselves.
\v 10 Say to the righteous that [it is] good, \qac ǁ\qac* Because they eat the fruit of their doings.
\v 11 Woe to the wicked—evil, \qac ǁ\qac* Because the deed of his hand is done to him.
\v 12 My people—its exactors [are] sucklings, \qac ǁ\qac* And women have ruled over it. My people—your eulogists are causing to err, \qac ǁ\qac* And the way of your paths swallowed up.
\v 13 \nd Yhwh\nd* has stood up to plead, \qac ǁ\qac* And He is standing to judge the peoples.
\v 14 \nd Yhwh\nd* enters into judgment \qac ǁ\qac* With [the] elderly of His people, and its heads: “And you, you have consumed the vineyard, \qac ǁ\qac* Plunder of the poor [is] in your houses.
\v 15 Why? Why do you [do this]? You bruise My people, \qac ǁ\qac* And you grind the faces of the poor.” A declaration of the Lord, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* And \nd Yhwh\nd* says:
\v 16 “Because that daughters of Zion have been haughty, \qac ǁ\qac* And they walk stretching out the neck, \qac ǁ\qac* And deceiving [with] the eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* They go walking and mincing, \qac ǁ\qac* And they make a jingling with their feet,
\v 17 The Lord has also scabbed \qac ǁ\qac* The crown of the head of daughters of Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* And \nd Yhwh\nd* exposes their simplicity.
\v 18 In that day the Lord turns aside \qac ǁ\qac* The beauty of the jingling ornaments, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the embroidered works, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the crescents,
\v 19 Of the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils,
\v 20 Of the headdresses, and the ornaments of the legs, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the bands, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the perfume boxes, and the amulets,
\v 21 Of the seals, and of the nose-rings,
\v 22 Of the costly apparel, and of the mantles, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the coverings, and of the purses,
\v 23 Of the mirrors, and of the linen garments, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the hoods, and of the veils,
\v 24 And it has been, instead of spice is muck, \qac ǁ\qac* And instead of a girdle, a rope, \qac ǁ\qac* And instead of curled work, baldness, \qac ǁ\qac* And instead of a stomacher a girdle of sackcloth.
\v 25 For instead of glory, your men fall by sword, \qac ǁ\qac* And your might in battle.
\v 26 And her openings have lamented and mourned, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, she has been emptied, she sits on the earth!”
\c 4
\p
\v 1 And seven women have taken hold on one man, \qac ǁ\qac* In that day, saying, “We eat our own bread, \qac ǁ\qac* And we put on our own raiment, \qac ǁ\qac* Only, let your name be called over us, \qac ǁ\qac* Remove our reproach.”
\v 2 In that day is the Shoot of \nd Yhwh\nd* for desire and for glory, \qac ǁ\qac* And the fruit of the earth \qac ǁ\qac* For excellence and for beauty to the escaped of Israel.
\v 3 And it has been, he who is left in Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* And he who is remaining in Jerusalem, “Holy” is said of him, \qac ǁ\qac* Of everyone who is written for life in Jerusalem.
\v 4 If the Lord has washed away \qac ǁ\qac* The filth of daughters of Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* And purges the blood of Jerusalem from her midst, \qac ǁ\qac* By the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
\v 5 Then \nd Yhwh\nd* has created \qac ǁ\qac* Over every fixed place of Mount Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* And over her convocations, \qac ǁ\qac* A cloud by day, and smoke, \qac ǁ\qac* And the shining of a flaming fire by night, \qac ǁ\qac* That over all glory—a safeguard,
\v 6 And a covering may be, \qac ǁ\qac* For a shadow from drought by day, \qac ǁ\qac* And for a refuge, and for a hiding place, \qac ǁ\qac* From inundation and from rain!
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Now let me sing for my Beloved, \qac ǁ\qac* A song of my Beloved as to His vineyard: My beloved has a vineyard in a fruitful hill,
\v 2 And He fences it, and casts out its stones, \qac ǁ\qac* And plants it [with] a choice vine, \qac ǁ\qac* And builds a tower in its midst, \qac ǁ\qac* And has also hewn out a winepress in it, \qac ǁ\qac* And He waits for the yielding of grapes, \qac ǁ\qac* And it yields bad ones!
\v 3 And now, O inhabitant of Jerusalem and man of Judah, \qac ǁ\qac* Please judge between Me and My vineyard.
\v 4 What [is there] to do still to My vineyard, \qac ǁ\qac* That I have not done in it? For what reason have I waited for the yielding of grapes, \qac ǁ\qac* And it yields [only] bad ones?
\v 5 And now, pray, let Me cause you to know, \qac ǁ\qac* That which I am doing to My vineyard, \qac ǁ\qac* To turn its hedge aside, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been for consumption, \qac ǁ\qac* To break down its wall, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been for a treading-place.
\v 6 And I make it a waste, \qac ǁ\qac* It is not pruned, nor arranged, \qac ǁ\qac* And brier and thorn have gone up, \qac ǁ\qac* And I lay a charge on the thick clouds, \qac ǁ\qac* From raining on it rain.
\v 7 Because the vineyard of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] the house of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* And the man of Judah His pleasant plant, \qac ǁ\qac* And He waits for judgment, and behold, oppression, \qac ǁ\qac* For righteousness, and behold, a cry.
\v 8 Woe [to] those joining house to house, \qac ǁ\qac* They bring field near to field, \qac ǁ\qac* Until there is no place, \qac ǁ\qac* And you have been settled by yourselves \qac ǁ\qac* In the midst of the land!
\v 9 Do many houses not become a desolation by the weapons of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts? Great and good without inhabitant!
\v 10 For ten acres of vineyard yield one bath, \qac ǁ\qac* And a homer of seed yields an ephah.
\v 11 Woe [to] those rising early in the morning, \qac ǁ\qac* They pursue strong drink! Lingering in twilight, wine inflames them!
\v 12 And harp, and stringed instrument, tambourine, and pipe, \qac ǁ\qac* And wine, have been their banquets, \qac ǁ\qac* And they do not behold the work of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, they have not seen the work of His hands.
\v 13 Therefore my people removed without knowledge, \qac ǁ\qac* And its honorable ones are famished, \qac ǁ\qac* And its multitude dried up of thirst.
\v 14 Therefore Sheol has enlarged herself, \qac ǁ\qac* And has opened her mouth without limit. And its honor has gone down, and its multitude, \qac ǁ\qac* And its noise, and its exulting one—into her.
\v 15 And the low is bowed down, and the high humbled, \qac ǁ\qac* And the eyes of the haughty become low,
\v 16 And \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts is high in judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* And the Holy God sanctified in righteousness,
\v 17 And lambs have fed according to their leading, \qac ǁ\qac* And sojourners consume wastelands of the fat ones.
\v 18 Woe [to] those drawing out iniquity with cords of vanity, \qac ǁ\qac* And as [with] thick ropes of the cart—sin.
\v 19 Who are saying, “Let Him hurry, \qac ǁ\qac* Let Him hurry His work, that we may see, \qac ǁ\qac* And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel \qac ǁ\qac* Draw near and come, and we know.”
\v 20 Woe [to] those saying to evil “good,” and to good “evil,” \qac ǁ\qac* Putting darkness for light, and light for darkness, \qac ǁ\qac* Putting bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.
\v 21 Woe [to] the wise in their own eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* And—before their own faces—intelligent!
\v 22 Woe [to] the mighty to drink wine, \qac ǁ\qac* And men of strength to mingle strong drink.
\v 23 Declaring righteous the wicked for a bribe, \qac ǁ\qac* And the righteousness of the righteous \qac ǁ\qac* They turn aside from him.
\v 24 Therefore, as a tongue of fire devours stubble, \qac ǁ\qac* And flaming hay falls, \qac ǁ\qac* Their root is as muck, \qac ǁ\qac* And their flower goes up as dust. Because they have rejected the Law of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* And despised the saying of the Holy One of Israel.
\v 25 Therefore the anger of \nd Yhwh\nd* has burned among His people, \qac ǁ\qac* And He stretches out His hand against it, \qac ǁ\qac* And strikes it, and the mountains tremble, \qac ǁ\qac* And their carcass is as filth in the midst of the out-places. With all this His anger did not turn back, \qac ǁ\qac* And still His hand is stretched out!
\v 26 And He lifted up an ensign to the far-off nations, \qac ǁ\qac* And hissed to it from the end of the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And behold, with haste, it comes swiftly.
\v 27 There is none weary, nor stumbling in it, \qac ǁ\qac* It does not slumber, nor sleep, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor has the girdle of its loins been opened, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor the strap of its sandals drawn away.
\v 28 Whose arrows [are] sharp, and all its bows bent, \qac ǁ\qac* Hooves of its horses have been reckoned as flint, \qac ǁ\qac* And its wheels as a windstorm!
\v 29 Its roaring [is] like a lioness, \qac ǁ\qac* It roars like young lions, \qac ǁ\qac* And it howls, and seizes prey, \qac ǁ\qac* And carries away safely, and there is none delivering.
\v 30 And it howls against it in that day as the howling of a sea, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has looked attentively to the land, \qac ǁ\qac* And behold, darkness—distress, \qac ǁ\qac* And light has been darkened by its abundance!

\p
\v 1 In the year of the death of King Uzziah—I see the Lord, sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and His train is filling the temple.
\v 2 Seraphim are standing above it: each one has six wings; with two [each] covers its face, and with two [each] covers its feet, and with two [each] flies.
\v 3 And this one has called to that, and has said: “HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, [is] \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* The fullness of all the earth [is] His glory!”
\v 4 And the posts of the thresholds are moved by the voice of him who is calling, and the house is full of smoke.
\v 5 And I say, “Woe to me, for I have been silent, \qac ǁ\qac* For I [am] a man of unclean lips, \qac ǁ\qac* And I am dwelling in [the] midst of a people of unclean lips, \qac ǁ\qac* Because the King, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, my eyes have seen.”
\v 6 And one of the seraphim flees to me, and in his hand—a burning coal (with tongs he has taken [it] from off the altar),
\v 7 and he strikes against my mouth and says: “Behold, this has struck against your lips, \qac ǁ\qac* And your iniquity is turned aside, \qac ǁ\qac* And your sin is covered.”
\v 8 And I hear the voice of the Lord, saying, “Whom do I send? And who goes for Us?” And I say, “Here I [am], send me.”
\v 9 And He says, “Go, and you have said to this people, Hearing you hear, and you do not understand, \qac ǁ\qac* And seeing you see, and you do not know.
\v 10 Declare the heart of this people fat, \qac ǁ\qac* And declare its ears heavy, \qac ǁ\qac* And declare its eyes dazzled, \qac ǁ\qac* Lest it see with its eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* And hear with its ears, and consider with its heart, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has turned back, and has health.”
\v 11 And I say, “Until when, O Lord?” And He says, “Surely until cities have been ruined without inhabitant, \qac ǁ\qac* And houses without man, \qac ǁ\qac* And the ground is ruined—a desolation,
\v 12 And \nd Yhwh\nd* has put man far off, \qac ǁ\qac* And the forsaken part [is] great in the heart of the land.
\v 13 And yet a tenth in it, and it has turned, \qac ǁ\qac* And has been for a burning, \qac ǁ\qac* As a teil-tree, and as an oak, that in falling, \qac ǁ\qac* Has substance in them, \qac ǁ\qac* The holy seed [is] its substance!”

\v 1 And it comes to pass in the days of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, [that] Rezin king of Aram, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, have gone up to Jerusalem, to battle against it, and he is not able to fight against it.
\v 2 And it is declared to the house of David, saying, “Aram has been led toward Ephraim,” and his heart and the heart of his people is moved, like the moving of trees of a forest by the presence of wind.
\v 3 And \nd Yhwh\nd* says to Isaiah, “Now go forth to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-Jashub, to the end of the conduit of the upper pool, to the highway of the fuller’s field,
\v 4 and you have said to him: Take heed, and be quiet, do not fear, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not let your heart be timid, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of these two tails of smoking brands, \qac ǁ\qac* For the fierceness of the anger of Rezin and Aram, \qac ǁ\qac* And the son of Remaliah.
\v 5 Because that Aram counseled evil against you, Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying,
\v 6 We go up into Judah, and we distress it, \qac ǁ\qac* And we divide it to ourselves, \qac ǁ\qac* And we cause a king to reign in its midst—The son of Tabeal.
\v 7 Thus said Lord \nd Yhwh\nd*: It does not stand, nor will it be!
\v 8 For the head of Aram [is] Damascus, \qac ǁ\qac* And the head of Damascus [is] Rezin, \qac ǁ\qac* And within sixty-five years \qac ǁ\qac* Is Ephraim broken from [being] a people.
\v 9 And the head of Ephraim [is] Samaria, \qac ǁ\qac* And the head of Samaria [is] the son of Remaliah. If you do not give credence, \qac ǁ\qac* Surely you are not steadfast.”
\v 10 And \nd Yhwh\nd* adds to speak to Ahaz, saying,
\v 11 “Ask for a sign from your God \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Make the request deep, or make [it] high upwards.”
\v 12 And Ahaz says, “I do not ask nor try \nd Yhwh\nd*.”
\v 13 And he says, “Now hear, O house of David, \qac ǁ\qac* Is it a little thing for you to weary men, \qac ǁ\qac* That you also weary my God?
\v 14 Therefore the Lord Himself gives a sign to you, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, the virgin is conceiving, \qac ǁ\qac* And is bringing forth a Son, \qac ǁ\qac* And has called His Name Immanuel,
\v 15 He eats butter and honey, \qac ǁ\qac* When He knows to refuse evil, and to fix on good.
\v 16 For before the youth knows \qac ǁ\qac* To refuse evil, and to fix on good, \qac ǁ\qac* The land you are distressed with is forsaken, because of her two kings.
\v 17 \nd Yhwh\nd* brings on you, and on your people, \qac ǁ\qac* And on the house of your father, \qac ǁ\qac* Days that have not come, \qac ǁ\qac* Even from the day of the turning aside of Ephraim from Judah, \qac ǁ\qac* By the king of Asshur.”
\v 18 And it has come to pass in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* hisses for a fly that [is] in the extremity of the brooks of Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And for a bee that [is] in the land of Asshur.
\v 19 And they have come, and all of them rested in the desolate valleys, \qac ǁ\qac* And in holes of the rocks, and on all the thorns, \qac ǁ\qac* And on all the commendable things.
\v 20 In that day the Lord shaves, \qac ǁ\qac* By a razor that is hired beyond the river, \qac ǁ\qac* By the king of Asshur, \qac ǁ\qac* The head, and the hair of the feet, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, it also consumes the beard.
\v 21 And it has come to pass in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* A man keeps alive a heifer of the herd, \qac ǁ\qac* And two of the flock,
\v 22 And it has come to pass, \qac ǁ\qac* He eats butter from the abundance of the yielding of milk, \qac ǁ\qac* For everyone who is left in the heart of the land eats butter and honey.
\v 23 And it has come to pass in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* Every place where there are one thousand vines, \qac ǁ\qac* At one thousand pieces of silver, \qac ǁ\qac* Is for briers and for thorns.
\v 24 He comes there with arrows and with bow, \qac ǁ\qac* Because all the land is brier and thorn.
\v 25 And all the hills that are kept in order with a mattock, \qac ǁ\qac* There does not come [for] fear of brier and thorn, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been for the sending forth of ox, \qac ǁ\qac* And for the treading of sheep!
\c 8
\p
\v 1 And \nd Yhwh\nd* says to me, “Take a great tablet to yourself, and write on it with an engraving tool of man, \qac ǁ\qac* To hurry spoil, enjoy prey.”
\v 2 And I cause faithful witnesses to testify to me, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah.
\v 3 And I draw near to the prophetess, and she conceives, and bears a son; and \nd Yhwh\nd* says to me, “Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz,
\v 4 for before the youth knows to cry, My father, and, My mother, one takes away the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria, before the king of Asshur.”
\v 5 And \nd Yhwh\nd* adds to speak to me again, saying,
\v 6 “Because that this people has refused \qac ǁ\qac* The waters of Shiloah that go softly, \qac ǁ\qac* And is rejoicing with Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
\v 7 Therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up on them, \qac ǁ\qac* The waters of the river, the mighty and the great \qac ǁ\qac* (The king of Asshur, and all his glory), \qac ǁ\qac* And it has gone up over all its streams, \qac ǁ\qac* And has gone on over all its banks.
\v 8 And it has passed on into Judah, \qac ǁ\qac* It has overflown and passed over, \qac ǁ\qac* It comes to the neck, \qac ǁ\qac* And the stretching out of its wings \qac ǁ\qac* Has been the fullness of the breadth of your land, O Immanuel!
\v 9 Be friends, O nations, and be broken, \qac ǁ\qac* And give ear, all you far-off ones of earth, \qac ǁ\qac* Gird yourselves, and be broken, \qac ǁ\qac* Gird yourselves, and be broken.
\v 10 Take counsel, and it is broken, \qac ǁ\qac* Speak a word, and it does not stand, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of Immanuel!”
\v 11 For thus has \nd Yhwh\nd* spoken to me with strength of hand, and instructs me against walking in the way of this people, saying,
\v 12 “You do not say, A confederacy, \qac ǁ\qac* To all to whom this people says, A confederacy, \qac ǁ\qac* And its fear you do not fear, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor declare fearful.
\v 13 \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts—Him you sanctify, \qac ǁ\qac* And He [is] your Fear, and He your Dread,
\v 14 And He has been for a sanctuary, \qac ǁ\qac* And for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of falling, \qac ǁ\qac* To the two houses of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* For a trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 15 And many among them have stumbled and fallen, \qac ǁ\qac* And been broken, and snared, and captured.”
\v 16 Bind up the testimony, \qac ǁ\qac* Seal the Law among My disciples.
\v 17 And I have waited for \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have looked for Him.
\v 18 Behold, I, and the children whom \nd Yhwh\nd* has given to me, \qac ǁ\qac* [Are] for signs and for wonders in Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* From \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, who is dwelling in Mount Zion.
\v 19 And when they say to you, “Seek to those having familiar spirits, \qac ǁ\qac* And to wizards, who chatter and mutter,” \qac ǁ\qac* Does a people not seek to its God? To the dead on behalf of the living?
\v 20 To the Law and to the testimony! If not, let them say after this manner, “That there is no dawn to it.”
\v 21 And it has passed over into it, hardened and hungry, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has come to pass, \qac ǁ\qac* That it is hungry, and has been angry, \qac ǁ\qac* And made light of its king, and of its God, \qac ǁ\qac* And has looked upwards.
\v 22 And it looks attentively to the land, \qac ǁ\qac* And behold, adversity and darkness! Dimness, distress, and thick darkness are driven away, \qac ǁ\qac* But not the dimness for which she is in distress!
\c 9
\p
\v 1 For [there will be] no gloom on her who [is] distressed as at the former time. The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, \qac ǁ\qac* So the latter has honored the way of the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* Beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
\v 2 The people who are walking in darkness \qac ǁ\qac* Have seen a great light, \qac ǁ\qac* Dwellers in a land of death-shade, \qac ǁ\qac* Light has shone on them.
\v 3 You have multiplied the nation, \qac ǁ\qac* You have made its joy great, \qac ǁ\qac* They have rejoiced before You as the joy in harvest, \qac ǁ\qac* As [men] rejoice in their apportioning spoil.
\v 4 Because the yoke of its burden, \qac ǁ\qac* And the staff of its shoulder, the rod of its exactor, \qac ǁ\qac* You have broken as [in] the day of Midian.
\v 5 For every battle of a warrior [is] with rushing, and raiment rolled in blood, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been for burning—fuel of fire.
\v 6 For a Child has been born to us, \qac ǁ\qac* A Son has been given to us, \qac ǁ\qac* And the dominion is on His shoulder, \qac ǁ\qac* And He calls His Name \qac ǁ\qac* Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, \qac ǁ\qac* Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace.
\v 7 Of the increase of [His] dominion, \qac ǁ\qac* And of peace, there is no end, \qac ǁ\qac* On the throne of David, and on His kingdom, \qac ǁ\qac* To establish it, and to support it, \qac ǁ\qac* In judgment and in righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* From now on, even for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* The zeal of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts does this.
\v 8 The Lord has sent a word into Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has fallen in Israel.
\v 9 And the people have known—all of it, Ephraim, and the inhabitant of Samaria, \qac ǁ\qac* In pride and in greatness of heart, saying,
\v 10 “Bricks have fallen, and we build hewn work, \qac ǁ\qac* Sycamores have been cut down, and we renew cedars.”
\v 11 And \nd Yhwh\nd* sets the adversaries of Rezin on high above him, \qac ǁ\qac* And he joins his enemies together,
\v 12 Aram from before, and Philistia from behind, \qac ǁ\qac* And they devour Israel with the whole mouth. With all this His anger has not turned back, \qac ǁ\qac* And His hand is still stretched out.
\v 13 And the people has not turned back to Him who is striking it, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have not sought \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts.
\v 14 And \nd Yhwh\nd* cuts off head and tail from Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* Branch and reed—the same day.
\v 15 Elderly and accepted of faces—he [is] the head, \qac ǁ\qac* And prophet teaching falsehood—he [is] the tail.
\v 16 And the eulogists of this people are causing to err, \qac ǁ\qac* And its eulogized ones are consumed.
\v 17 Therefore, the Lord does not rejoice over its young men, \qac ǁ\qac* And He does not pity its orphans and its widows, \qac ǁ\qac* For everyone [is] profane, and an evildoer, \qac ǁ\qac* And every mouth is speaking folly. With all this His anger has not turned back, \qac ǁ\qac* And His hand is still stretched out.
\v 18 For wickedness has burned as a fire, \qac ǁ\qac* It devours brier and thorn, \qac ǁ\qac* And it kindles in thickets of the forest, \qac ǁ\qac* And they lift themselves up, an exaltation of smoke!
\v 19 In the wrath of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts \qac ǁ\qac* The land has been consumed, \qac ǁ\qac* And the people is as fuel of fire; A man has no pity on his brother,
\v 20 And cuts down on the right, and has been hungry, \qac ǁ\qac* And he devours on the left, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have not been satisfied, \qac ǁ\qac* They each devour the flesh of his own arm.
\v 21 Manasseh—Ephraim, and Ephraim—Manasseh, \qac ǁ\qac* Together they [are] against Judah, \qac ǁ\qac* With all this His anger has not turned back. And His hand is still stretched out!
\c 10
\p
\v 1 “Woe [to] those decreeing decrees of iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* And writers who have prescribed perverseness,
\v 2 Of My people, \qac ǁ\qac* That widows may be their prey, \qac ǁ\qac* That they may spoil the fatherless.
\v 3 And what do you do at a day of inspection? And at desolation that comes from afar? Near whom do you flee for help? And where do you leave your glory?
\v 4 It has bowed down without Me \qac ǁ\qac* In the place of a bound one, \qac ǁ\qac* And they fall in the place of the slain.” With all this His anger has not turned back, \qac ǁ\qac* And His hand is still stretched out.
\v 5 “Woe [to] Asshur, a rod of My anger, \qac ǁ\qac* And My indignation [is] a staff in their hand.
\v 6 I send him against a profane nation, \qac ǁ\qac* And concerning a people of My wrath \qac ǁ\qac* I charge him, \qac ǁ\qac* To spoil spoil, and to seize prey, \qac ǁ\qac* And to make it a treading-place as the clay of out places.
\v 7 And he does not think [it] so, \qac ǁ\qac* And his heart does not reckon [it] so, \qac ǁ\qac* For—to destroy [is] in his heart, \qac ǁ\qac* And to cut off nations—not a few.
\v 8 For he says, Are my princes not altogether kings?
\v 9 Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus?
\v 10 As my hand has gotten to the kingdoms of a worthless thing, and their carved images, \qac ǁ\qac* [Greater] than Jerusalem and than Samaria,
\v 11 Do I not—as I have done to Samaria, \qac ǁ\qac* And to her worthless things, \qac ǁ\qac* So do to Jerusalem and to her grievous things?”
\v 12 And it has come to pass, \qac ǁ\qac* When the Lord fulfills all His work \qac ǁ\qac* In Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, \qac ǁ\qac* I see concerning the fruit of the greatness \qac ǁ\qac* Of the heart of the king of Asshur, \qac ǁ\qac* And concerning the glory of the height of his eyes.
\v 13 For he has said, “I have worked by the power of my hand, \qac ǁ\qac* And by my wisdom, for I have been intelligent, \qac ǁ\qac* And I remove borders of the peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have spoiled their chief ones, \qac ǁ\qac* And I put down the inhabitants as a mighty one,
\v 14 And my hand gets to the wealth of the peoples as to a nest, \qac ǁ\qac* And as a gathering of forsaken eggs \qac ǁ\qac* I have gathered all the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And there has not been one moving wing, \qac ǁ\qac* Or opening mouth, or whispering.”
\v 15 Does the axe glorify itself \qac ǁ\qac* Against him who is hewing with it? Does the saw magnify itself \qac ǁ\qac* Against him who is shaking it? As a rod waving those lifting it up! As a staff lifting up that which is not wood!
\v 16 Therefore the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* Sends leanness among his fat ones, \qac ǁ\qac* And under his glory \qac ǁ\qac* He kindles a burning \qac ǁ\qac* As the burning of a fire.
\v 17 And the light of Israel has been for a fire, \qac ǁ\qac* And his Holy One for a flame, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has burned, and devoured his thorn \qac ǁ\qac* And his brier in one day.
\v 18 And the glory of his forest, and his fruitful field, \qac ǁ\qac* He consumes from soul even to flesh, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been as the fainting of a standard-bearer.
\v 19 And the rest of the trees of his forest [are] few, \qac ǁ\qac* And a youth writes them.
\v 20 And it has come to pass in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* The remnant of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* And the escaped of the house of Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not add anymore to lean on its striker, \qac ǁ\qac* And have leaned on \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* The Holy One of Israel, in truth.
\v 21 A remnant returns—a remnant of Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* To the Mighty God.
\v 22 For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* A remnant of it returns, \qac ǁ\qac* A consumption determined, \qac ǁ\qac* Overflowing [with] righteousness.
\v 23 For a consumption that is determined, \qac ǁ\qac* The Lord, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* Is making in the midst of all the land.
\v 24 Therefore, thus said the Lord, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts: “Do not be afraid, My people, inhabiting Zion, because of Asshur, \qac ǁ\qac* He strikes you with a rod, \qac ǁ\qac* And his staff lifts up against you, in the way of Egypt.
\v 25 For yet a very little [while], \qac ǁ\qac* And the indignation has been completed, \qac ǁ\qac* And My anger by their wearing out.”
\v 26 And \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts is awaking for him, \qac ǁ\qac* A scourge like the striking of Midian at the rock Oreb, \qac ǁ\qac* And his rod [is] over the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has lifted it in the way of Egypt.
\v 27 And it has come to pass in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* His burden is turned from off your shoulder, \qac ǁ\qac* And his yoke from off your neck, \qac ǁ\qac* And the yoke has been destroyed, because of prosperity.
\v 28 He has come in against Aiath, \qac ǁ\qac* He has passed over into Migron, \qac ǁ\qac* At Michmash he looks after his vessels.
\v 29 They have gone over the passage, \qac ǁ\qac* They have made Geba a lodging place, \qac ǁ\qac* Rama has trembled, \qac ǁ\qac* Gibeah of Saul fled.
\v 30 Cry aloud [with] your voice, daughter of Gallim, \qac ǁ\qac* Give attention, Laish! Answer her, Anathoth.
\v 31 Madmenah has fled away, \qac ǁ\qac* The inhabitants of the high places have hardened themselves.
\v 32 Yet today to remain in Nob, \qac ǁ\qac* The mountain of the daughter of Zion waves its hand, \qac ǁ\qac* The hill of Jerusalem.
\v 33 Behold, the Lord, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* Is lopping a branch with violence, \qac ǁ\qac* And the high of stature are cut down, \qac ǁ\qac* And the lofty have become low,
\v 34 And He has gone around the thickets of the forest with iron, \qac ǁ\qac* And Lebanon falls by a mighty one!
\c 11
\p
\v 1 And a Rod has come out from the stock of Jesse, \qac ǁ\qac* And a Branch is fruitful from his roots.
\v 2 The Spirit of \nd Yhwh\nd* has rested on Him, \qac ǁ\qac* The Spirit of wisdom and understanding, \qac ǁ\qac* The Spirit of counsel and might, \qac ǁ\qac* The Spirit of knowledge and fear of \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 3 To refresh Him in the fear of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And He does not judge by the sight of His eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor decides by the hearing of His ears.
\v 4 And He has judged the poor in righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And decided for the humble of earth in uprightness, \qac ǁ\qac* And has struck earth with the rod of His mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* And He puts the wicked to death with the breath of His lips.
\v 5 And righteousness has been the girdle of His loins, \qac ǁ\qac* And faithfulness—the girdle of His reins.
\v 6 “And a wolf has sojourned with a lamb, \qac ǁ\qac* And a leopard lies down with a kid, \qac ǁ\qac* And calf, and young lion, and fatling [are] together, \qac ǁ\qac* And a little youth is leader over them.
\v 7 And cow and bear feed, \qac ǁ\qac* Together their young ones lie down, \qac ǁ\qac* And a lion eats straw as an ox.
\v 8 And a suckling has played by the hole of a cobra, \qac ǁ\qac* And on the den of a viper \qac ǁ\qac* The weaned one has put his hand.
\v 9 They do no evil, nor destroy in all My holy mountain, \qac ǁ\qac* For the earth has been full with the knowledge of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* As the waters are covering the sea.”
\v 10 And there has been, in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* A Root of Jesse that is standing for an ensign of peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* Nations seek Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And His rest has been glorious!
\v 11 And it has come to pass in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* The Lord adds His power a second time, \qac ǁ\qac* To get the remnant of His people that is left, \qac ǁ\qac* From Asshur, and from Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And from Pathros, and from Cush, \qac ǁ\qac* And from Elam, and from Shinar, \qac ǁ\qac* And from Hamath, and from islands of the sea,
\v 12 And He has lifted up an ensign to nations, \qac ǁ\qac* And gathers the driven away of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* And He assembles the scattered of Judah, \qac ǁ\qac* From the four wings of the earth.
\v 13 And has turned aside the envy of Ephraim, \qac ǁ\qac* And the adversaries of Judah are cut off, \qac ǁ\qac* Ephraim does not envy Judah, \qac ǁ\qac* And Judah does not distress Ephraim.
\v 14 And they have flown on the shoulder of the Philistines westward, \qac ǁ\qac* Together they spoil the sons of the east, \qac ǁ\qac* Edom and Moab sending forth their hand, \qac ǁ\qac* And sons of Ammon obeying them.
\v 15 And \nd Yhwh\nd* has devoted to destruction \qac ǁ\qac* The tongue of the Sea of Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And has waved His hand over the river, \qac ǁ\qac* In the terror of His wind, \qac ǁ\qac* And has struck it at the seven streams, \qac ǁ\qac* And has caused [men] to tread [it] with shoes.
\v 16 And there has been a highway, \qac ǁ\qac* For the remnant of His people that is left, from Asshur, \qac ǁ\qac* As there was for Israel in the day of his coming up out of the land of Egypt!
\c 12
\p
\v 1 And you have said in that day: “I thank you, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Though You have been angry with me, \qac ǁ\qac* Your anger turns back, \qac ǁ\qac* And You comfort me.
\v 2 Behold, God [is] my salvation, I trust, and do not fear, \qac ǁ\qac* For my strength and song [is] \nd Yah\nd*—\nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And He is to me for salvation.
\v 3 And you have drawn waters with joy \qac ǁ\qac* Out of the fountains of salvation,
\v 4 And you have said in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* Give praise to \nd Yhwh\nd*, call on His Name. Make His acts known among the peoples. Make mention that His Name is set on high.
\v 5 Praise \nd Yhwh\nd*, for He has done excellence, \qac ǁ\qac* This is known in all the earth.
\v 6 Cry aloud, and sing, O inhabitant of Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* For the Holy One of Israel [is] great in your midst!”
\c 13
\p
\v 1 The burden of Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz has seen:
\v 2 “Lift up an ensign on a high mountain, \qac ǁ\qac* Raise the voice to them, wave the hand, \qac ǁ\qac* And they go into the openings of nobles.
\v 3 I have given charge to My sanctified ones, \qac ǁ\qac* Also I have called My mighty ones for My anger, \qac ǁ\qac* Those rejoicing at My excellence.”
\v 4 A voice of a multitude in the mountains, \qac ǁ\qac* A likeness of a numerous people, \qac ǁ\qac* A voice of noise from the kingdoms of nations who are gathered, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts inspecting a host of battle!
\v 5 They are coming in from a far-off land, \qac ǁ\qac* From the end of the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* and the instruments of His indignation, \qac ǁ\qac* To destroy all the land.
\v 6 Howl, for the Day of \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] near, \qac ǁ\qac* It comes as destruction from the Mighty.
\v 7 Therefore, all hands fail, \qac ǁ\qac* And every heart of man melts.
\v 8 And they have been troubled, \qac ǁ\qac* Pains and pangs take them, \qac ǁ\qac* They are pained as a travailing woman, \qac ǁ\qac* A man marvels at his friend, \qac ǁ\qac* The appearance of flames—their faces!
\v 9 Behold, the Day of \nd Yhwh\nd* comes, \qac ǁ\qac* Fierce, with wrath, and heat of anger, \qac ǁ\qac* To make the land become a desolation, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, He destroys its sinning ones from it.
\v 10 For the stars of the heavens, and their constellations, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not cause their light to shine, \qac ǁ\qac* The sun has been darkened in its going out, \qac ǁ\qac* And the moon does not cause its light to come forth.
\v 11 “And I have appointed evil on the world, \qac ǁ\qac* And on the wicked their iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* And have caused the excellence of the proud to cease, \qac ǁ\qac* And I make the excellence of the terrible low.
\v 12 I make man more rare than fine gold, \qac ǁ\qac* And a common man than pure gold of Ophir.
\v 13 Therefore I cause the heavens to tremble, \qac ǁ\qac* And the earth shakes from its place, \qac ǁ\qac* In the wrath of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* And in a day of the heat of His anger.
\v 14 And it has been, as a roe driven away, \qac ǁ\qac* And as a flock that has no gatherer, \qac ǁ\qac* Each to his people—they turn, \qac ǁ\qac* And each to his land—they flee.
\v 15 Everyone who is found is thrust through, \qac ǁ\qac* And everyone who is added falls by sword.
\v 16 And their sucklings are dashed to pieces before their eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* Their houses are spoiled, and their wives lain with.
\v 17 Behold, I am stirring up the Medes against them, \qac ǁ\qac* Who do not esteem silver, \qac ǁ\qac* And gold—they do not delight in it.
\v 18 And bows dash young men to pieces, \qac ǁ\qac* And they do not pity the fruit of the womb, \qac ǁ\qac* Their eye has no pity on sons.
\v 19 And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, \qac ǁ\qac* The glory, the excellence of the Chaldeans, \qac ǁ\qac* Has been as overthrown by God, \qac ǁ\qac* With Sodom and with Gomorrah.
\v 20 She does not sit forever, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor continue to many generations, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor does Arab pitch tent there, \qac ǁ\qac* And shepherds do not lie down there.
\v 21 And desert-dwellers have lain down there, \qac ǁ\qac* And their houses have been full of howlers, \qac ǁ\qac* And daughters of an ostrich have dwelt there, \qac ǁ\qac* And goats skip there.
\v 22 And howlers—he has responded in his forsaken habitations, \qac ǁ\qac* And dragons in palaces of delight, \qac ǁ\qac* And her time [is] near to come, \qac ǁ\qac* And her days are not drawn out!”

\v 1 For \nd Yhwh\nd* loves Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And has fixed again on Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* And given them rest on their own land, \qac ǁ\qac* And the sojourner has been joined to them, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have been admitted to the house of Jacob.
\v 2 And peoples have taken them, \qac ǁ\qac* And have brought them to their place, \qac ǁ\qac* And the house of Israel has inherited them, \qac ǁ\qac* On the land of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* For menservants and for maidservants, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have been captors of their captors, \qac ǁ\qac* And have ruled over their exactors.
\v 3 And it has come to pass, \qac ǁ\qac* In the day of \nd Yhwh\nd*’s giving rest to you, \qac ǁ\qac* From your grief, and from your trouble, \qac ǁ\qac* And from the sharp bondage, \qac ǁ\qac* That has been served on you,
\v 4 That you have taken up this allegory \qac ǁ\qac* Concerning the king of Babylon, and said, “How the exactor has ceased,
\v 5 The golden one has ceased. \nd Yhwh\nd* has broken the staff of the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* The scepter of rulers.
\v 6 He who is striking peoples in wrath, \qac ǁ\qac* A striking without intermission, \qac ǁ\qac* He who is ruling nations in anger, \qac ǁ\qac* Pursuing without restraint!
\v 7 At rest—all the earth has been quiet, \qac ǁ\qac* They have broken forth [into] singing.
\v 8 Even firs have rejoiced over you, \qac ǁ\qac* Cedars of Lebanon, [saying], Since you have lain down, \qac ǁ\qac* The hewer does not come up against us.
\v 9 Sheol beneath has been troubled at you, \qac ǁ\qac* To meet your coming in, \qac ǁ\qac* It is waking up Rephaim for you, \qac ǁ\qac* All chief ones of earth, \qac ǁ\qac* It has raised up from their thrones \qac ǁ\qac* All kings of nations.
\v 10 All of them answer and say to you, Even you have become weak like us! You have become like to us!
\v 11 Your excellence has been brought down to Sheol, \qac ǁ\qac* The noise of your stringed instruments, \qac ǁ\qac* The worm has been spread out under you, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, the worm is covering you.
\v 12 How you have fallen from the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* O shining one, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to earth, \qac ǁ\qac* O weakener of nations.
\v 13 And you said in your heart: I go up into the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* I raise my throne above the stars of God, \qac ǁ\qac* And I sit on the mountain of meeting in the sides of the north.
\v 14 I go up above the heights of a thick cloud, I am like to the Most High.
\v 15 Only—you are brought down to Sheol, \qac ǁ\qac* To the sides of the pit.
\v 16 Your beholders look to you, they attend to you, \qac ǁ\qac* Is this the man causing the earth to tremble, \qac ǁ\qac* Shaking kingdoms?
\v 17 He has made the world as a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has broken down his cities, \qac ǁ\qac* He did not open the house of his bound ones.
\v 18 All kings of nations—all of them, \qac ǁ\qac* Have lain down in glory, each in his house,
\v 19 And you have been cast out of your grave, \qac ǁ\qac* As an abominable branch, raiment of the slain, \qac ǁ\qac* Thrust through ones of the sword, \qac ǁ\qac* Going down to the sons of the pit, \qac ǁ\qac* As a carcass trodden down.
\v 20 You are not united with them in burial, \qac ǁ\qac* For you have destroyed your land, \qac ǁ\qac* You have slain your people, \qac ǁ\qac* The seed of evildoers is not named for all time.
\v 21 Prepare slaughter for his sons; Because of the iniquity of their fathers, \qac ǁ\qac* They do not rise, nor have possessed the land, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor filled the face of the world [with] cities.
\v 22 And I have risen up against them,” \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* “And have cut off, in reference to Babylon, \qac ǁ\qac* Name and remnant, and continuator and successor,” \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 23 “And have made it for a possession of a hedgehog, \qac ǁ\qac* And ponds of waters, \qac ǁ\qac* And swept it with the broom of destruction,” \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts!
\v 24 \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts has sworn, saying, “As I thought—so has it not been? And as I counseled—it stands;
\v 25 To break Asshur in My land, \qac ǁ\qac* And I tread him down on My mountain, \qac ǁ\qac* And his yoke has turned from off them, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, his burden turns aside from off their shoulder.
\v 26 This [is] the counsel that is counseled for all the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And this [is] the hand that is stretched out for all the nations.
\v 27 For \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts has purposed, \qac ǁ\qac* And who makes void? And His hand that is stretched out, \qac ǁ\qac* Who turns it back?”
\v 28 In the year of the death of King Ahaz was this burden:
\v 29 “Do not rejoice, Philistia, all of you, \qac ǁ\qac* That the rod of your striker has been broken, \qac ǁ\qac* For from the root of a serpent comes out a viper, \qac ǁ\qac* And its fruit [is] a flying, burning serpent.
\v 30 And the firstborn of the poor have delighted, \qac ǁ\qac* And the needy lie down in confidence, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have put to death your root with famine, \qac ǁ\qac* And it slays your remnant.
\v 31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city, \qac ǁ\qac* You are melted, Philistia, all of you, \qac ǁ\qac* For smoke has come from the north, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is none alone in his set places.”
\v 32 And what does one answer the messengers of a nation? That \nd Yhwh\nd* has founded Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* And the poor of His people take refuge in it!

\v 1 The burden of Moab. Because in a night Ar of Moab was destroyed—It has been cut off, \qac ǁ\qac* Because in a night Kir of Moab was destroyed—It has been cut off.
\v 2 He has gone up to Bajith and Dibon, \qac ǁ\qac* The high places—to weep, \qac ǁ\qac* Moab howls on Nebo and on Medeba, \qac ǁ\qac* Baldness [is] on all its heads, every beard cut off.
\v 3 In its out-places they girded on sackcloth, \qac ǁ\qac* On its pinnacles, and in its broad places, \qac ǁ\qac* Everyone howls—going down with weeping.
\v 4 And Heshbon and Elealeh cry, \qac ǁ\qac* Their voice has been heard to Jahaz, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore the armed ones of Moab shout, \qac ǁ\qac* His life has been grievous to him.
\v 5 My heart [is] toward Moab, \qac ǁ\qac* Her fugitives cry to Zoar, a heifer of the third [year], \qac ǁ\qac* For—the ascent of Luhith—He goes up in it with weeping, \qac ǁ\qac* For in the way of Horonaim, \qac ǁ\qac* They wake up a cry of destruction.
\v 6 For the waters of Nimrim are desolations, \qac ǁ\qac* For the hay has been withered, \qac ǁ\qac* The tender grass has been finished, \qac ǁ\qac* There has not been a green thing.
\v 7 Therefore the abundance he made, and their store, \qac ǁ\qac* They carry to the Brook of the Willows.
\v 8 For the cry has gone around the border of Moab, \qac ǁ\qac* Its howling [is] to Eglaim, \qac ǁ\qac* And its howling [is] to Beer-Elim.
\v 9 For the waters of Dimon have been full of blood, \qac ǁ\qac* For I set additions on Dimon, \qac ǁ\qac* A lion for the escaped of Moab, \qac ǁ\qac* And for the remnant of Adamah!
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Send a lamb [to] the ruler of the land, \qac ǁ\qac* From Selah in the wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* To the mountain of the daughter of Zion.
\v 2 And it has come to pass, \qac ǁ\qac* As a wandering bird, cast out of a nest, \qac ǁ\qac* Are daughters of Moab, [at] fords of Arnon.
\v 3 Bring in counsel, do judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* Make your shadow as night in the midst of noon, \qac ǁ\qac* Hide outcasts, do not reveal the wanderer.
\v 4 My outcasts sojourn in you, O Moab, \qac ǁ\qac* Be a secret hiding place for them, \qac ǁ\qac* From the face of a destroyer, \qac ǁ\qac* For the extortioner has ceased, \qac ǁ\qac* Devastation has been finished, \qac ǁ\qac* The tramplers are consumed out of the land.
\v 5 And the throne is established in kindness, \qac ǁ\qac* And [One] has sat on it in truth, in the tent of David, \qac ǁ\qac* Judging and seeking judgment, and hastening righteousness.
\v 6 We have heard of the pride of Moab—very proud, \qac ǁ\qac* His pride, and his arrogance, and his wrath—his boastings [are] not right.
\v 7 Therefore Moab howls for Moab, all of it howls, \qac ǁ\qac* It meditates for the grape-cakes of Kir-Hareseth, \qac ǁ\qac* They are surely struck.
\v 8 Because fields of Heshbon languish, \qac ǁ\qac* The vine of Sibmah, \qac ǁ\qac* Lords of nations beat her choice vines, \qac ǁ\qac* They have come to Jazer, \qac ǁ\qac* They have wandered in a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* Her plants have spread themselves, \qac ǁ\qac* They have passed over a sea.
\v 9 Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer, \qac ǁ\qac* The vine of Sibmah, \qac ǁ\qac* I water you [with] my tear, \qac ǁ\qac* O Heshbon and Elealeh, \qac ǁ\qac* For—for your summer fruits, and for your harvest, \qac ǁ\qac* The shouting has fallen.
\v 10 And gladness and joy have been removed from the fruitful field, \qac ǁ\qac* And they do not sing in vineyards, nor shout, \qac ǁ\qac* The treader does not tread wine in the presses, \qac ǁ\qac* I have caused shouting to cease.
\v 11 Therefore my bowels sound as a harp for Moab, \qac ǁ\qac* And my inward parts for Kir-Haresh.
\v 12 And it has come to pass, when it has been seen, \qac ǁ\qac* That Moab has been weary on the high place, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has come to his sanctuary to pray, \qac ǁ\qac* And is not able.
\v 13 This [is] the word that \nd Yhwh\nd* has spoken to Moab from that time,
\v 14 And now \nd Yhwh\nd* has spoken, saying, “In three years, as years of a hired worker, \qac ǁ\qac* The glory of Moab is lightly esteemed, \qac ǁ\qac* With all the great multitude, \qac ǁ\qac* And the remnant [is] little, small, not mighty!”
\c 17
\p
\v 1 The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from [being] a city, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been a heap—a ruin.
\v 2 The cities of Aroer are forsaken, \qac ǁ\qac* They are for droves, and they have lain down, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is none troubling.
\v 3 And the fortress has ceased from Ephraim, \qac ǁ\qac* And the kingdom from Damascus, \qac ǁ\qac* And the remnant of Aram are as the glory of the sons of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts!
\v 4 And it has come to pass in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* The glory of Jacob waxes poor, \qac ǁ\qac* And the fatness of his flesh waxes lean.
\v 5 And it has come to pass, \qac ǁ\qac* As the gathering of the standing grain by the reaper, \qac ǁ\qac* And his arm reaps the ears, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has come to pass, \qac ǁ\qac* As the gathering of the ears in the Valley of Rephaim,
\v 6 And gleanings have been left in him, \qac ǁ\qac* As the surrounding of an olive, \qac ǁ\qac* Two—three berries on the top of a branch, \qac ǁ\qac* Four—five on the fruitful boughs, \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*, God of Israel!
\v 7 In that day man looks to His Maker, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, his eyes look to the Holy One of Israel,
\v 8 And he does not look to the altars. The work of his own hands, \qac ǁ\qac* And that which his own fingers made, He does not see—the Asherim and the images.
\v 9 In that day the cities of his strength are \qac ǁ\qac* As the forsaken thing of the forest, \qac ǁ\qac* And the branch that they have left, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of the sons of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* It has also been a desolation.
\v 10 Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not remembered the Rock of your strength, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore you plant plants of pleasantness, \qac ǁ\qac* And sow it with a strange shoot,
\v 11 You cause your plant to become great in the day, \qac ǁ\qac* And make your seed to flourish in the morning, \qac ǁ\qac* The harvest [is] a heap in a day of overflowing, \qac ǁ\qac* And of mortal pain.
\v 12 Woe [to] the multitude of many peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* They sound as the sounding of seas; And the roaring of nations, \qac ǁ\qac* As the roaring of mighty waters [that] make a crashing.
\v 13 Nations crash as the roaring of many waters, \qac ǁ\qac* And He rebuked them, \qac ǁ\qac* And they fled far off, \qac ǁ\qac* And were pursued as chaff of hills before wind, \qac ǁ\qac* And as a rolling thing before a windstorm.
\v 14 At evening, behold, terror, before morning it is not, \qac ǁ\qac* This [is] the portion of our spoilers, \qac ǁ\qac* And the lot of our plunderers!
\c 18
\p
\v 1 Behold, land shadowed [with] wings, \qac ǁ\qac* That [is] beyond the rivers of Cush,
\v 2 That is sending ambassadors by sea, \qac ǁ\qac* Even with implements of reed on the face of the waters—Go, swift messengers, \qac ǁ\qac* To a nation drawn out and peeled, \qac ǁ\qac* To a people fearful from its beginning and onward, \qac ǁ\qac* A nation meeting out by line, and treading down, \qac ǁ\qac* Whose land floods have spoiled.
\v 3 All you inhabitants of the world, \qac ǁ\qac* And you dwellers of earth, \qac ǁ\qac* At the lifting up of an ensign on hills you look, \qac ǁ\qac* And at the blowing of a horn you hear.
\v 4 For thus said \nd Yhwh\nd* to me: “I rest, and I look on My settled place, \qac ǁ\qac* As a clear heat on an herb. As a thick cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
\v 5 For before harvest, when the flower is perfect, \qac ǁ\qac* And the blossom is producing unripe fruit, \qac ǁ\qac* Then [One] has cut the sprigs with pruning hooks, \qac ǁ\qac* And the branches He has turned aside, cut down.
\v 6 They are left together to the ravenous bird of the mountains, \qac ǁ\qac* And to the beast of the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And the ravenous bird has summered on them, \qac ǁ\qac* And every beast of the earth winters on them.
\v 7 At that time a present is brought to \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* A nation drawn out and peeled. Even of a people fearful from the beginning until now, \qac ǁ\qac* A nation meting out by line, and treading down, \qac ǁ\qac* Whose land floods have spoiled, \qac ǁ\qac* To the place of the Name of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts—Mount Zion!”
\c 19
\p
\v 1 The burden of Egypt. Behold, \nd Yhwh\nd* is riding on a swift thick cloud, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has entered Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And the idols of Egypt have been moved at His presence, \qac ǁ\qac* And the heart of Egypt melts in its midst.
\v 2 And I armed Egyptians against Egyptians, \qac ǁ\qac* And they fought, each against his brother, \qac ǁ\qac* And each against his neighbor, \qac ǁ\qac* City against city, kingdom against kingdom.
\v 3 And the spirit of Egypt has been emptied out in its midst. And I swallow up its counsel, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have sought to the idols, \qac ǁ\qac* And to the charmers, \qac ǁ\qac* And to those having familiar spirits, \qac ǁ\qac* And to the wizards.
\v 4 And I have delivered the Egyptians \qac ǁ\qac* Into the hand of a hard lord, \qac ǁ\qac* And a strong king rules over them, \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of the Lord, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts.
\v 5 And waters have failed from the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* And a river is desolated and dried up.
\v 6 And they have turned away the flowings, \qac ǁ\qac* Brooks of the bulwark have been weak and dried up, \qac ǁ\qac* Reed and flag have withered.
\v 7 Exposed things by the brook, by the edge of the brook, \qac ǁ\qac* And every sown thing of the brook, has withered, \qac ǁ\qac* It has been driven away, and is not.
\v 8 And the fishers have lamented, \qac ǁ\qac* And all casting a hook into the brook have mourned, \qac ǁ\qac* And those spreading dragnets on the face of the waters have languished.
\v 9 And makers of fine flax have been ashamed, \qac ǁ\qac* And weavers of networks.
\v 10 And its foundations have been struck, \qac ǁ\qac* All making wages [are] afflicted in soul.
\v 11 Only, the princes of Zoan [are] fools, \qac ǁ\qac* The counsel of the wise ones of the counselors of Pharaoh has become brutish. How do you say to Pharaoh, “I am a son of the wise, a son of kings of antiquity?”
\v 12 Where [are] they now, your wise ones? Indeed, let them now tell [it] to you, \qac ǁ\qac* And they know what \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts has counseled against Egypt!
\v 13 Princes of Zoan have been foolish, \qac ǁ\qac* Princes of Noph have been lifted up, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have caused Egypt to err, \qac ǁ\qac* The chief of her tribes.
\v 14 \nd Yhwh\nd* has mingled in her midst \qac ǁ\qac* A spirit of perverseness, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have caused Egypt to err in all its work, \qac ǁ\qac* As a drunkard errs in his vomit.
\v 15 And there is no work to Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* That head or tail, branch or reed, may do.
\v 16 In that day Egypt is like women, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has mourned, and been afraid, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of the waving of the hand of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* That He is waving over it.
\v 17 And the land of Judah has been to Egypt for a cause of staggering, \qac ǁ\qac* Everyone who mentions it, fears for himself, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of the counsel of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* That He is counseling against it.
\v 18 In that day there are five cities in the land of Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* Speaking the lip of Canaan, \qac ǁ\qac* And swearing to \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* “The city of destruction,” is said of one.
\v 19 In that day there is an altar to \nd Yhwh\nd* \qac ǁ\qac* In the midst of the land of Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And a standing pillar to \nd Yhwh\nd* near its border,
\v 20 And it has been for a sign and for a testimony, \qac ǁ\qac* To \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts in the land of Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* For they cry to \nd Yhwh\nd* from the face of oppressors, \qac ǁ\qac* And He sends a Savior to them, \qac ǁ\qac* Even a great one, and has delivered them.
\v 21 And \nd Yhwh\nd* has been known to Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And the Egyptians have known \nd Yhwh\nd* in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* And done sacrifice and present, \qac ǁ\qac* And vowed a vow to \nd Yhwh\nd*, and completed [it].
\v 22 And \nd Yhwh\nd* has struck Egypt, striking and healing, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have turned back to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has accepted their plea, \qac ǁ\qac* And has healed them.
\v 23 In that day a highway is out of Egypt to Asshur, \qac ǁ\qac* And the Assyrians have come into Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And the Egyptians into Asshur, \qac ǁ\qac* And the Egyptians have served with the Assyrians.
\v 24 In that day Israel is third, \qac ǁ\qac* With Egypt, and with Asshur, \qac ǁ\qac* A blessing in the heart of the earth.
\v 25 In that \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts blessed it, saying, “Blessed [is] My people—Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And the work of My hands—Asshur, \qac ǁ\qac* And My inheritance—Israel!”
\c 20
\p
\v 1 In the year of the coming in of Tartan to Ashdod, when Sargon king of Asshur sends him, and he fights against Ashdod and captures it,
\v 2 at that time \nd Yhwh\nd* spoke by the hand of Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and you have loosed the sackcloth from off your loins, and you draw your sandal from off your foot,” and he does so, going naked and barefoot.
\v 3 And \nd Yhwh\nd* says, “As My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot three years, a sign and a wonder for Egypt and for Cush,
\v 4 so the king of Asshur leads the captivity of Egypt, and the expulsion of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, with seat uncovered—the nakedness of Egypt;
\v 5 and they have been frightened and ashamed of Cush their confidence, and of Egypt their beauty,
\v 6 and the inhabitant of this island has said in that day—Behold, thus [is] our trust, \qac ǁ\qac* To where we have fled for help, \qac ǁ\qac* To be delivered from the king of Asshur, \qac ǁ\qac* And how do we escape—we?”
\c 21
\p
\v 1 The burden of the wilderness of the sea. Like windstorms in the south for passing through, \qac ǁ\qac* It has come from the wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* From a fearful land.
\v 2 A hard vision has been declared to me, \qac ǁ\qac* The treacherous dealer is dealing treacherously, \qac ǁ\qac* And the destroyer is destroying. Go up, O Elam, besiege, O Media, \qac ǁ\qac* I have caused all its sighing to cease.
\v 3 Therefore my loins have been filled [with] great pain, \qac ǁ\qac* Pangs have seized me as pangs of a travailing woman, \qac ǁ\qac* I have been bent down by hearing, \qac ǁ\qac* I have been troubled by seeing.
\v 4 My heart has wandered, trembling has terrified me, \qac ǁ\qac* He has made the twilight of my desire a fear to me,
\v 5 Arrange the table, watch in the watchtower, \qac ǁ\qac* Eat, drink, rise, you heads, anoint the shield,
\v 6 For thus said the Lord to me: “Go, station the watchman, \qac ǁ\qac* Let him declare that which he sees.”
\v 7 And he has seen a chariot—a couple of horsemen, \qac ǁ\qac* The rider of a donkey, the rider of a camel, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has given attention—He has increased attention!
\v 8 And he cries, “A lion, my lord! I am continually standing on a watchtower by day, \qac ǁ\qac* And I am stationed on my ward whole nights.
\v 9 And behold, this, the chariot of a man is coming, \qac ǁ\qac* A couple of horsemen.” And he answers and says: “Fallen, fallen has Babylon, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has broken all the carved images of her gods to the earth.
\v 10 O my threshing, and the son of my floor, \qac ǁ\qac* That which I heard from \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, God of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* I have declared to you!”
\v 11 The burden of Dumah. [One] is calling to me from Seir, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?”
\v 12 The watchman has said, “Morning has come, and also night, \qac ǁ\qac* If you inquire, inquire, return, come.”
\v 13 The burden on Arabia. You lodge in a forest in Arabia, \qac ǁ\qac* O caravans of Dedanim.
\v 14 Inhabitants of the land of Tema \qac ǁ\qac* Have brought water to meet the thirsty, \qac ǁ\qac* With his bread they came before a fugitive.
\v 15 For they fled from the face of destructions, \qac ǁ\qac* From the face of an outstretched sword, \qac ǁ\qac* And from the face of a trodden bow, \qac ǁ\qac* And from the face of the grievousness of battle.
\v 16 For thus said the Lord to me: “Within a year, as years of a hired worker, \qac ǁ\qac* All the glory of Kedar has been consumed.
\v 17 And the remnant of the number of bow-men, \qac ǁ\qac* The mighty of the sons of Kedar, are few, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd*, God of Israel, has spoken!”
\c 22
\p
\v 1 The burden of the Valley of Vision. What is [troubling] you now, that you have gone up, \qac ǁ\qac* All of you—to the roofs?
\v 2 Full of stirs—a noisy city—an exulting city, \qac ǁ\qac* Your pierced are not pierced of the sword, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor dead in battle.
\v 3 All your rulers fled from the bow together, \qac ǁ\qac* All found of you have been bound, \qac ǁ\qac* They have been kept bound together, \qac ǁ\qac* They have fled far off.
\v 4 Therefore I said, “Look [away] from me, \qac ǁ\qac* I am bitter in my weeping, do not hurry to comfort me, \qac ǁ\qac* For the destruction of the daughter of my people.”
\v 5 For a day of noise, and of treading down, \qac ǁ\qac* And of perplexity, [is] to the Lord, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* In the Valley of Vision, digging down a wall, \qac ǁ\qac* And crying to the mountain.
\v 6 And Elam has carried a quiver, \qac ǁ\qac* In a chariot of men—horsemen, \qac ǁ\qac* And Kir has exposed a shield.
\v 7 And it comes to pass, \qac ǁ\qac* The choice of your valleys have been full of chariots, \qac ǁ\qac* And the horsemen diligently place themselves at the gate.
\v 8 And one removes the covering of Judah, \qac ǁ\qac* And in that day you look \qac ǁ\qac* To the armor of the house of the forest,
\v 9 And you have seen the breaches of the City of David, \qac ǁ\qac* For they have become many, \qac ǁ\qac* And you gather the waters of the lower pool,
\v 10 And you numbered the houses of Jerusalem, \qac ǁ\qac* And you break down the houses to fortify the wall.
\v 11 And you made a ditch between the two walls, \qac ǁ\qac* For the waters of the old pool, \qac ǁ\qac* And you have not looked to its Maker, \qac ǁ\qac* And you have not seen its Framer of old.
\v 12 And the Lord calls, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* In that day, to weeping and to lamentation, \qac ǁ\qac* And to baldness and to girding on of sackcloth,
\v 13 And behold, joy and gladness, slaying of oxen, \qac ǁ\qac* And slaughtering of sheep, \qac ǁ\qac* Eating of flesh, and drinking of wine, \qac ǁ\qac* Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.
\v 14 And it has been revealed in my ears, \qac ǁ\qac* [By] \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts: This iniquity is not pardoned to you, \qac ǁ\qac* Until you die, said the Lord, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts.
\v 15 Thus said the Lord, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts: “Go forth, go to this steward, \qac ǁ\qac* To Shebna, who [is] over the house:
\v 16 What are you [doing] here? And who has [allowed] you here? That you have hewn out a tomb for yourself here? Hewing his tomb on high, \qac ǁ\qac* Carving a dwelling for himself in a rock.
\v 17 Behold, \nd Yhwh\nd* is casting you up and down, \qac ǁ\qac* A casting up and down, O mighty one,
\v 18 And your coverer covering, wrapping around, \qac ǁ\qac* Wraps you around, O babbler, \qac ǁ\qac* On a land of broad sides—there you die, \qac ǁ\qac* And there the chariots of your glory [are] the shame of the house of your lord.
\v 19 And I have thrust you from your station, \qac ǁ\qac* And he throws you down from your office.
\v 20 And it has come to pass in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* That I have called to My servant, \qac ǁ\qac* To Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
\v 21 And I have clothed him with your coat, \qac ǁ\qac* And I strengthen him with your girdle, \qac ǁ\qac* And I give your garment into his hand, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has been for a father to the inhabitant of Jerusalem, \qac ǁ\qac* And to the house of Judah.
\v 22 And I have placed the key \qac ǁ\qac* Of the house of David on his shoulder, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has opened, and none is shutting, \qac ǁ\qac* And has shut, and none is opening.
\v 23 And I have fixed him [as] a nail in a steadfast place, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has been for a throne of glory \qac ǁ\qac* To the house of his father.
\v 24 And they have hanged on him \qac ǁ\qac* All the glory of the house of his father, \qac ǁ\qac* The offspring and the issue, \qac ǁ\qac* All vessels of small quality, \qac ǁ\qac* From vessels of basins to all vessels of flagons.
\v 25 In that day—a declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* The nail that is fixed is moved \qac ǁ\qac* In a steadfast place, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, it has been cut down, and has fallen, \qac ǁ\qac* And the burden that [is] on it has been cut off, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* has spoken!”
\c 23
\p
\v 1 The Burden of Tyre. Howl, you ships of Tarshish, \qac ǁ\qac* For it has been destroyed, \qac ǁ\qac* Without house, without entrance, \qac ǁ\qac* From the land of Chittim it was revealed to them.
\v 2 Be silent, you inhabitants of the island, \qac ǁ\qac* Trader of Sidon, passing the sea, they filled you.
\v 3 And the seed of Sihor [is] in many waters, \qac ǁ\qac* Her increase [is] the harvest of the brook, \qac ǁ\qac* And she is a market of nations.
\v 4 Be ashamed, O Sidon; for the sea spoke, \qac ǁ\qac* The strength of the sea, saying, “I have not been pained, nor have I brought forth, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor have I nourished young men, [nor] brought up virgins.”
\v 5 As they are pained [at] the report of Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* So [at] the report of Tyre.
\v 6 Pass over to Tarshish, howl, you inhabitants of the island,
\v 7 Is this your exulting one? Her antiquity [is] from the days of old, \qac ǁ\qac* Her own feet carry her far off to sojourn.
\v 8 Who has counseled this against Tyre, \qac ǁ\qac* The crowning one, whose traders [are] princes, \qac ǁ\qac* Her merchants—the honored of earth?
\v 9 \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts has counseled it, \qac ǁ\qac* To defile the excellence of all beauty, \qac ǁ\qac* To make light all the honored of earth.
\v 10 Pass through your land as a brook, \qac ǁ\qac* Daughter of Tarshish, \qac ǁ\qac* There is no longer a girdle.
\v 11 He has stretched out His hand over the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* He has caused kingdoms to tremble, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* has charged concerning the merchant one, \qac ǁ\qac* To destroy her strong places.
\v 12 And He says, “You do not add to exult anymore, \qac ǁ\qac* O oppressed one, virgin daughter of Sidon, \qac ǁ\qac* To Chittim arise, pass over, \qac ǁ\qac* Even there—there is no rest for you.”
\v 13 Behold, the land of the Chaldeans—this people was not, \qac ǁ\qac* Asshur founded it for desert-dwellers, \qac ǁ\qac* They raised its watchtowers, \qac ǁ\qac* They lifted up her palaces—He has appointed her for a ruin!
\v 14 Howl, you ships of Tarshish, \qac ǁ\qac* For your strength has been destroyed.
\v 15 And it has come to pass in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* That Tyre is forgotten seventy years, \qac ǁ\qac* According to the days of one king. At the end of seventy years there is to Tyre as the song of the harlot.
\v 16 Take a harp, go around the city, O forgotten harlot, play well, \qac ǁ\qac* Multiply song that you may be remembered.
\v 17 And it has come to pass, \qac ǁ\qac* At the end of seventy years \nd Yhwh\nd* inspects Tyre, \qac ǁ\qac* And she has returned to her wage, \qac ǁ\qac* And she committed fornication \qac ǁ\qac* With all kingdoms of the earth on the face of the ground.
\v 18 And her merchandise and her wage have been holy to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Not treasured up nor stored, \qac ǁ\qac* For her merchandise is to those sitting before \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* To eat to satiety, and for a lasting covering!
\c 24
\p
\v 1 Behold, \nd Yhwh\nd* is emptying the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And is making it desolate, \qac ǁ\qac* And has overturned [it on] its face, \qac ǁ\qac* And has scattered its inhabitants.
\v 2 And it has been—as a people so a priest, \qac ǁ\qac* As the servant so his master, \qac ǁ\qac* As the maidservant so her mistress, \qac ǁ\qac* As the buyer so the seller, \qac ǁ\qac* As the lender so the borrower, \qac ǁ\qac* As the usurer so he who is lifting [it] on himself.
\v 3 The earth is utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* has spoken this word:
\v 4 The earth has mourned, faded, \qac ǁ\qac* The world has languished, faded, \qac ǁ\qac* They have languished—the high place of the people of the earth.
\v 5 And the earth has been defiled under its inhabitants, \qac ǁ\qac* Because they have transgressed laws, \qac ǁ\qac* They have changed a statute, \qac ǁ\qac* They have made void a perpetual covenant.
\v 6 Therefore a curse has consumed the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And the inhabitants in it become desolate, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore inhabitants of the earth have been consumed, \qac ǁ\qac* And few men have been left.
\v 7 The new wine has mourned, the vine languished, \qac ǁ\qac* All the joyful of heart have sighed.
\v 8 The joy of tambourines has ceased, \qac ǁ\qac* The noise of exulting ones has ceased, \qac ǁ\qac* The joy of a harp has ceased.
\v 9 They do not drink wine with a song, \qac ǁ\qac* Strong drink is bitter to those drinking it.
\v 10 It was broken down—a city of emptiness, \qac ǁ\qac* Every house has been shut from [its] entrance.
\v 11 In out-places [is] a cry over the wine, \qac ǁ\qac* All joy has been darkened, \qac ǁ\qac* The joy of the land has been removed.
\v 12 Desolation [is] left in the city, \qac ǁ\qac* And the gate is struck [with] ruin.
\v 13 When thus it is in the heart of the land, \qac ǁ\qac* In the midst of the peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* As the surrounding of the olive, \qac ǁ\qac* As gleanings when harvest has been finished,
\v 14 They lift up their voice, \qac ǁ\qac* They sing of the excellence of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* They have cried aloud from the sea.
\v 15 Therefore honor \nd Yhwh\nd* in prosperity, \qac ǁ\qac* In islands of the sea, the Name of \nd Yhwh\nd*, God of Israel.
\v 16 From the skirt of the earth we heard songs, \qac ǁ\qac* The desire of the righteous. And I say, “Leanness [is] to me, \qac ǁ\qac* Leanness [is] to me, woe [is] to me.” Treacherous dealers dealt treacherously, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, treachery, treacherous dealers dealt treacherously.
\v 17 Fear, and a snare, and a trap, \qac ǁ\qac* [Are] on you, O inhabitant of the earth.
\v 18 And it has come to pass, \qac ǁ\qac* He who is fleeing from the noise of the fear falls into the snare, \qac ǁ\qac* And he who is coming up from the midst of the snare, \qac ǁ\qac* Is captured by the trap, \qac ǁ\qac* For windows have been opened on high, \qac ǁ\qac* And foundations of the earth are shaken.
\v 19 The earth has been utterly broken down, \qac ǁ\qac* The earth has been utterly broken, \qac ǁ\qac* The earth has been utterly moved.
\v 20 The earth staggers greatly as a drunkard, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been moved as a lodge, \qac ǁ\qac* And its transgression has been heavy on it, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has fallen, and does not add to rise.
\v 21 And it has come to pass in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* lays a charge on the host of the high place in the high place, \qac ǁ\qac* And on the kings of the earth on the earth.
\v 22 And they have been gathered—A gathering of bound ones in a pit, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have been shut up in a prison, \qac ǁ\qac* And after a multitude of days are inspected.
\v 23 And the moon has been confounded, \qac ǁ\qac* And the sun has been ashamed, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts has reigned \qac ǁ\qac* In Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, \qac ǁ\qac* And before His elderly—glory!
\c 25
\p
\v 1 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, You [are] my God, I exalt You, I confess Your Name, \qac ǁ\qac* For You have done a wonderful thing, \qac ǁ\qac* Counsels of old, steadfastness, O steadfast One.
\v 2 For You made of a city a heap, \qac ǁ\qac* Of a fortified city a ruin, \qac ǁ\qac* A high place of strangers from [being] a city, \qac ǁ\qac* It is not built for all time.
\v 3 Therefore a strong people honors You, \qac ǁ\qac* A city of the terrible nations fears You.
\v 4 For You have been a stronghold for the poor, \qac ǁ\qac* A stronghold for the needy in his distress, \qac ǁ\qac* A refuge from storm, a shadow from heat, \qac ǁ\qac* When the spirit of the terrible [is] as a storm—a wall.
\v 5 As heat in a dry place, \qac ǁ\qac* You humble the noise of strangers, \qac ǁ\qac* [As] heat with the shadow of a thick cloud, \qac ǁ\qac* The singing of the terrible is humbled.
\v 6 And \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts has made, \qac ǁ\qac* For all the peoples in this mountain, \qac ǁ\qac* A banquet of fat things, \qac ǁ\qac* A banquet of preserved things, \qac ǁ\qac* Fat things full of marrow, \qac ǁ\qac* Preserved things—refined.
\v 7 And He has swallowed up in this mountain \qac ǁ\qac* The face of the wrapping that is wrapped over all the peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the covering that is spread over all the nations.
\v 8 He has swallowed up death in victory, \qac ǁ\qac* And Lord \nd Yhwh\nd* has wiped [the] tear from off all faces, \qac ǁ\qac* And He turns aside the reproach of His people from off all the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* has spoken.
\v 9 And [one] has said in that day, “Behold, this [is] our God, \qac ǁ\qac* We waited for Him, and He saves us, \qac ǁ\qac* This [is] \nd Yhwh\nd*, we have waited for Him, \qac ǁ\qac* We are glad and rejoice in His salvation!”
\v 10 For the hand of \nd Yhwh\nd* rests on this mountain, \qac ǁ\qac* And Moab is trodden down under Him, \qac ǁ\qac* As straw is trodden down on a dunghill.
\v 11 And He spread out His hands in its midst, \qac ǁ\qac* As the swimmer spreads out to swim; And He has humbled his excellence \qac ǁ\qac* With the machinations of his hands.
\v 12 And the fortress of the high place of your walls \qac ǁ\qac* He has bowed down—He has made low, \qac ǁ\qac* He has caused [it] to come to the earth—to dust.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 In that day this song is sung in the land of Judah: “We have a strong city, \qac ǁ\qac* He makes salvation [for] walls and bulwark.
\v 2 Open the gates, \qac ǁ\qac* That a righteous nation may enter, \qac ǁ\qac* Preserving steadfastness.
\v 3 You keep [him] in peace [whose] imagination [is] stayed—peace! For he is confident in You.
\v 4 Trust in \nd Yhwh\nd* forever, \qac ǁ\qac* For in \nd Yah\nd*—\nd Yhwh\nd* [is] a rock of ages,
\v 5 For He bowed down the dwellers on high, \qac ǁ\qac* A city set on high He makes low, \qac ǁ\qac* He makes it low to the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* He causes it to come to the dust,
\v 6 A foot treads it down, \qac ǁ\qac* Feet of the poor—steps of the weak.
\v 7 The path for the righteous [is] uprightness, \qac ǁ\qac* O upright One, \qac ǁ\qac* You ponder the path of the righteous.
\v 8 Also, [in] the path of Your judgments, \qac ǁ\qac* O \nd Yhwh\nd*, we have waited [for] You, \qac ǁ\qac* To Your Name and to Your remembrance \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] the desire of the soul.
\v 9 I desired You in the night [with] my soul, \qac ǁ\qac* Also, I seek You earnestly [with] my spirit within me, \qac ǁ\qac* For when Your judgments [are] on the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* The inhabitants of the world have learned righteousness.
\v 10 The wicked finds favor, \qac ǁ\qac* He has not learned righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* He deals perversely in a land of straightforwardness, \qac ǁ\qac* And does not see the excellence of \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 11 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, Your hand [is] high—they do not see, \qac ǁ\qac* They see the zeal of the people, and are ashamed, \qac ǁ\qac* Also, the fire consumes Your adversaries.
\v 12 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, You appoint peace to us, \qac ǁ\qac* For You have also worked all our works for us.
\v 13 O our God \nd Yhwh\nd*, lords have ruled us besides You, \qac ǁ\qac* Only, by You we make mention of Your Name.
\v 14 Dead—they do not live, \qac ǁ\qac* Rephaim, they do not rise, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore You have inspected and destroy them, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, you destroy all their memory.
\v 15 You have added to the nation, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* You have added to the nation, \qac ǁ\qac* You have been honored, \qac ǁ\qac* You have put all the ends of the earth far off.
\v 16 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, in distress they missed You, \qac ǁ\qac* They have poured out a whisper, \qac ǁ\qac* Your discipline [is] on them.
\v 17 When a pregnant woman comes near to the birth, \qac ǁ\qac* She is pained—she cries in her pangs, \qac ǁ\qac* So we have been from Your face, O \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 18 We have conceived, we have been pained. We have brought forth, as it were, wind, \qac ǁ\qac* We do not work salvation in the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor do the inhabitants of the world fall.
\v 19 Your dead live—My dead body, they rise. Awake and sing, you dwellers in the dust, \qac ǁ\qac* For the dew of herbs [is] your dew, \qac ǁ\qac* And you cause the land of Rephaim to fall.
\v 20 Come, My people, enter into your inner chambers, \qac ǁ\qac* And shut your doors behind you, \qac ǁ\qac* Hide yourself shortly [for] a moment until the indignation passes over.
\v 21 For behold, \nd Yhwh\nd* is coming out of His place, \qac ǁ\qac* To charge the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth on him, \qac ǁ\qac* And the earth has revealed her blood, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor does she cover her slain anymore!”
\c 27
\p
\v 1 In that day \nd Yhwh\nd* lays a charge, \qac ǁ\qac* With His sword—the sharp, and the great, and the strong, \qac ǁ\qac* On leviathan—a fleeing serpent, \qac ǁ\qac* And on leviathan—a crooked serpent, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has slain the dragon that [is] in the sea.
\v 2 In that day respond to her, “A desirable vineyard,
\v 3 I, \nd Yhwh\nd*, am its keeper, \qac ǁ\qac* I water it every moment, \qac ǁ\qac* Lest any lay a charge against it, \qac ǁ\qac* Night and day I keep it!
\v 4 Fury is not in Me; Who gives Me a brier—a thorn in battle? I step into it, \qac ǁ\qac* I burn it at once.
\v 5 Or—he takes hold on My strength, \qac ǁ\qac* [That] he makes peace with Me, \qac ǁ\qac* [And] he makes peace with Me.”
\v 6 He causes those coming in to take root, \qac ǁ\qac* Jacob blossoms, and Israel has flourished, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have filled the face of the world [with] increase.
\v 7 Has He struck him as the striking of his striker? Does He slay as the slaying of his slain?
\v 8 In measure, in sending it forth, you strive with it, \qac ǁ\qac* He has taken away by His sharp wind, \qac ǁ\qac* In the day of an east wind,
\v 9 Therefore the iniquity of Jacob is covered by this, \qac ǁ\qac* And this [is] all the fruit—To take away his sin, \qac ǁ\qac* In his setting all the stones of an altar, \qac ǁ\qac* As chalkstones beaten in pieces, \qac ǁ\qac* They do not rise—Asherim and images.
\v 10 For the fortified city [is] alone, \qac ǁ\qac* A habitation cast out and forsaken as a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* There the calf delights, \qac ǁ\qac* And there it lies down, \qac ǁ\qac* And has consumed its branches.
\v 11 In the withering of its branch it is broken off, \qac ǁ\qac* Women are coming in [and] setting it on fire, \qac ǁ\qac* For it [is] not a people of understanding, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore its Maker does not pity it, \qac ǁ\qac* And its Former does not favor it.
\v 12 And it has come to pass in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* beats out from the branch of the river, \qac ǁ\qac* To the stream of Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And you are gathered one by one, O sons of Israel.
\v 13 And it has come to pass in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* It is blown with a great horn, \qac ǁ\qac* And those perishing in the land of Asshur have come in, \qac ǁ\qac* And those cast out in the land of Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And have bowed themselves to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* In the holy mountain—in Jerusalem!
\c 28
\p
\v 1 Woe [to] the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim. And the fading flower of the beauty of his glory, \qac ǁ\qac* That [is] on the head of the fat valley of the broken down of wine.
\v 2 Behold, a mighty and strong one [is] to the Lord, \qac ǁ\qac* As a storm of hail—a destructive shower, \qac ǁ\qac* As an inundation of mighty waters overflowing, \qac ǁ\qac* He cast down to the earth with the hand.
\v 3 The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim is trodden down by feet,
\v 4 And the fading flower of the beauty of his glory \qac ǁ\qac* That [is] on the head of the fat valley, \qac ǁ\qac* Has been as its first-fruit before summer, \qac ǁ\qac* That its beholder sees; He swallows it while it [is] yet in his hand.
\v 5 In that day \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts is \qac ǁ\qac* For a crown of beauty, and for a circlet of glory, \qac ǁ\qac* To the remnant of His people.
\v 6 And for a spirit of judgment \qac ǁ\qac* To him who is sitting in the judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* And for might [to] those turning back the battle to the gate.
\v 7 And even these have erred through wine, \qac ǁ\qac* And have wandered through strong drink, \qac ǁ\qac* Priest and prophet erred through strong drink, \qac ǁ\qac* They have been swallowed up of the wine, \qac ǁ\qac* They wandered because of the strong drink, \qac ǁ\qac* They have erred in seeing, \qac ǁ\qac* They have stumbled judicially.
\v 8 For all tables have been full of vomit, \qac ǁ\qac* Filth—without place!
\v 9 By whom does He teach knowledge? And by whom does He cause to understand the report? The weaned from milk, the removed from breasts,
\v 10 For rule on rule, rule on rule, \qac ǁ\qac* Line on line, line on line, \qac ǁ\qac* A little here, a little there,
\v 11 For by scorned lip, and by another tongue, \qac ǁ\qac* Does He speak to this people.
\v 12 To whom He has said, “This [is] the rest, give rest to the weary, \qac ǁ\qac* And this—the refreshing”: And they have not been willing to hear,
\v 13 And to whom a word of \nd Yhwh\nd* has been, \qac ǁ\qac* Rule on rule, rule on rule, \qac ǁ\qac* Line on line, line on line, \qac ǁ\qac* A little here, a little there, \qac ǁ\qac* So that they go and have stumbled backward, \qac ǁ\qac* And been broken, and snared, and captured.
\v 14 Therefore, hear a word of \nd Yhwh\nd*, you men of scorning, \qac ǁ\qac* Ruling this people that [is] in Jerusalem.
\v 15 Because you have said: “We have made a covenant with death, \qac ǁ\qac* And we have made a provision with Sheol, \qac ǁ\qac* An overflowing scourge, when it passes over, \qac ǁ\qac* Does not meet us, \qac ǁ\qac* Though we have made a lie our refuge, \qac ǁ\qac* And have been hidden in falsehood.”
\v 16 Therefore, thus said Lord \nd Yhwh\nd*: “Behold, I am laying a foundation in Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* A stone—a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a settled foundation, \qac ǁ\qac* He who is believing does not make haste.
\v 17 And I have put judgment for a line, \qac ǁ\qac* And righteousness for a plummet, \qac ǁ\qac* And hail sweeps away the refuge of lies, \qac ǁ\qac* And waters overflow the secret hiding place.
\v 18 And your covenant with death has been annulled, \qac ǁ\qac* And your provision with Sheol does not stand, \qac ǁ\qac* An overflowing scourge, when it passes over, \qac ǁ\qac* Then you have been to it for a treading-place.
\v 19 From the fullness of its passing over it takes you, \qac ǁ\qac* For it passes over morning by morning, \qac ǁ\qac* By day and by night, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been only a trembling to consider the report.
\v 20 For the bed has been shorter \qac ǁ\qac* Than to stretch one’s self out in, \qac ǁ\qac* And the covering has been narrower \qac ǁ\qac* Than to wrap one’s self up in.
\v 21 For as \nd Yhwh\nd* rises [at] Mount Perazim, \qac ǁ\qac* As He is troubled [at] the valley in Gibeon, \qac ǁ\qac* To do His work—strange [is] His work, \qac ǁ\qac* And to do His deed—strange [is] His deed.”
\v 22 And now, do not show yourselves scorners, \qac ǁ\qac* Lest your bands are strong, \qac ǁ\qac* For a consumption, that is determined, \qac ǁ\qac* I have heard, by the Lord, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] for all the land.
\v 23 Give ear, and hear my voice, \qac ǁ\qac* Attend, and hear my saying:
\v 24 Does the plowman plow the whole day to sow? He opens and harrows his ground!
\v 25 Has he not, if he has made its face level, \qac ǁ\qac* Then scattered fitches, and sprinkles cumin, \qac ǁ\qac* And has placed the principal wheat, \qac ǁ\qac* And the appointed barley, \qac ǁ\qac* And the rye [in] its own border?
\v 26 And his God instructs him for judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* He directs him.
\v 27 For fitches are not threshed with a sharp-pointed thing, \qac ǁ\qac* And the wheel of a cart turned around on cumin, \qac ǁ\qac* For fitches are beaten out with a staff, \qac ǁ\qac* And cumin with a rod.
\v 28 Bread-[grain] is beaten small, \qac ǁ\qac* For he does not severely thresh it forever, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor has a wheel of his cart crushed [it], \qac ǁ\qac* Nor do his hooves beat it small.
\v 29 Even this from \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts has gone out, \qac ǁ\qac* He has made counsel wonderful, \qac ǁ\qac* He has made wisdom great!
\c 29
\p
\v 1 Woe [to] Ariel, Ariel, \qac ǁ\qac* The city of the encampment of David! Add year to year, let festivals go around.
\v 2 And I have sent distress to Ariel, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been lamentation and mourning, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been to me as Ariel.
\v 3 And I encamped, O babbler, against you, \qac ǁ\qac* And I laid siege against you—a camp. And I raised up bulwarks against you.
\v 4 And you have been low, \qac ǁ\qac* You speak from the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And make your saying low from the dust, \qac ǁ\qac* And your voice has been from the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* As one having a familiar spirit, \qac ǁ\qac* And your saying whispers from the dust,
\v 5 And as small dust has been \qac ǁ\qac* The multitude of those scattering you, \qac ǁ\qac* And as chaff passing on the multitude of the terrible, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been in an instant—suddenly.
\v 6 You are inspected by \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, \qac ǁ\qac* With thunder, and with an earthquake, \qac ǁ\qac* And great noise, windstorm, and whirlwind, \qac ǁ\qac* And flame of devouring fire.
\v 7 And as a dream, a vision of night, \qac ǁ\qac* Has been the multitude of all the nations \qac ǁ\qac* Who are warring against Ariel, \qac ǁ\qac* And all its warriors, and its bulwark, \qac ǁ\qac* Even of those distressing her.
\v 8 And it has been, as when the hungry dreams, \qac ǁ\qac* And behold, he is eating, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has awoken, \qac ǁ\qac* And his soul [is] empty, \qac ǁ\qac* And as when the thirsty dreams, \qac ǁ\qac* And behold, he is drinking, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has awoken, \qac ǁ\qac* And behold, he is weary, \qac ǁ\qac* And his soul is longing, \qac ǁ\qac* So is the multitude of all the nations \qac ǁ\qac* Who are warring against Mount Zion.
\v 9 Linger and wonder, look, indeed, look, \qac ǁ\qac* Be drunk, and not with wine, \qac ǁ\qac* Stagger, and not with strong drink.
\v 10 For \nd Yhwh\nd* has poured out a spirit of deep sleep on you, \qac ǁ\qac* And He closes your eyes—the prophets, \qac ǁ\qac* And your heads—the seers—He covered.
\v 11 And the vision of the whole is to you, \qac ǁ\qac* As words of the sealed scroll, \qac ǁ\qac* That they give to one knowing scrolls, \qac ǁ\qac* Saying, “Please read this,” \qac ǁ\qac* And he has said, “I am not able, for it [is] sealed”;
\v 12 And the scroll is given to him who has not known scrolls, \qac ǁ\qac* Saying, “Please read this,” \qac ǁ\qac* And he has said, “I have not known scrolls.”
\v 13 And the Lord says: “Because this people has drawn near with its mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have honored Me with its lips, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has put its heart far off from Me, \qac ǁ\qac* And their fear of Me is a precept taught by men!
\v 14 Therefore, behold, I am adding to do wonderfully with this people, \qac ǁ\qac* A wonder, and a marvel, \qac ǁ\qac* And the wisdom of its wise ones has perished, \qac ǁ\qac* And the understanding of its intelligent ones hides itself.”
\v 15 Woe [to] those going deep from \nd Yhwh\nd* to hide counsel, \qac ǁ\qac* And whose works have been in darkness. And they say, “Who is seeing us? And who is knowing us?”
\v 16 Your perversion! Is the potter esteemed as clay, \qac ǁ\qac* That the work says of its maker, “He has not made me?” And the framed thing said of its framer, “He did not understand?”
\v 17 Is it not yet a very little [while], \qac ǁ\qac* And Lebanon has turned into a fruitful field, \qac ǁ\qac* And the fruitful field is reckoned for a forest?
\v 18 And the deaf have heard the words of a scroll in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* And out of thick darkness, and out of darkness, \qac ǁ\qac* The eyes of the blind see.
\v 19 And the humble have added joy in \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And the poor among men \qac ǁ\qac* Rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
\v 20 For the terrible one has ceased, \qac ǁ\qac* And the scorner has been consumed, \qac ǁ\qac* And all watching for iniquity have been cut off,
\v 21 Who cause men to sin in word, \qac ǁ\qac* And lay a snare for a reprover in the gate, \qac ǁ\qac* And turn aside the righteous into emptiness.
\v 22 Therefore, thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Who ransomed Abraham, \qac ǁ\qac* Concerning the house of Jacob: “Jacob is not ashamed now, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor does his face now become pale,
\v 23 For in his seeing his children, \qac ǁ\qac* The work of My hand, in his midst, \qac ǁ\qac* They sanctify My Name, \qac ǁ\qac* And have sanctified the Holy One of Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And they declare the God of Israel fearful.
\v 24 And the erring in spirit have known understanding, \qac ǁ\qac* And murmurers learn doctrine!”
\c 30
\p
\v 1 Woe [to] apostate sons, \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*! To do counsel, and not from Me, \qac ǁ\qac* And to spread out a covering, and not of My Spirit, \qac ǁ\qac* So as to add sin to sin.
\v 2 Who are walking to go down to Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not asked My mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* To be strong in the strength of Pharaoh, \qac ǁ\qac* And to trust in the shadow of Egypt.
\v 3 And the strength of Pharaoh \qac ǁ\qac* Has been to you for shame, \qac ǁ\qac* And the trust in the shadow of Egypt confusion,
\v 4 For his princes were in Zoan, \qac ǁ\qac* And his messengers reach Hanes.
\v 5 He made all ashamed of a people that do not profit, \qac ǁ\qac* Not for help, and not for profit, \qac ǁ\qac* But for shame, and also for reproach!
\v 6 The burden of the beasts of the south. Into a land of adversity and distress, \qac ǁ\qac* Of young lion and of old lion, \qac ǁ\qac* From where [are] viper and flying, burning serpent, \qac ǁ\qac* They carry their wealth on the shoulder of donkeys, \qac ǁ\qac* And their treasures on the hump of camels, \qac ǁ\qac* To a people not profitable.
\v 7 Indeed, Egyptians [are] vanity, and help in vain, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore I have cried concerning this: “Their strength [is] to sit still.”
\v 8 No, go in, write it on a tablet with them, \qac ǁ\qac* And inscribe it on a scroll, \qac ǁ\qac* And it is for a latter day, for a witness for all time,
\v 9 That this [is] a people of rebellion, sons—liars, \qac ǁ\qac* Sons not willing to hear the Law of \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 10 Who have said to seers, “Do not see,” \qac ǁ\qac* And to prophets, “Do not prophesy to us straightforward things, \qac ǁ\qac* Speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits,
\v 11 Turn aside from the way, \qac ǁ\qac* Decline from the path, \qac ǁ\qac* Cause the Holy One of Israel \qac ǁ\qac* To cease from before us.”
\v 12 Therefore, thus said the Holy One of Israel: “Because of your kicking against this word, \qac ǁ\qac* And you trust in oppression, \qac ǁ\qac* And perverseness, and rely on it,
\v 13 Therefore this iniquity is to you as a breach falling, \qac ǁ\qac* Swelled out in a wall set on high, \qac ǁ\qac* Whose destruction comes suddenly, in an instant.
\v 14 And He has broken it \qac ǁ\qac* As the breaking of the potters’ bottle, \qac ǁ\qac* Beaten down—He does not spare, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor is there found, in its beating down, \qac ǁ\qac* A potsherd to take fire from the burning, \qac ǁ\qac* And to draw out waters from a ditch.”
\v 15 For thus said Lord \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* The Holy One of Israel: “In returning and rest you are saved, \qac ǁ\qac* In keeping quiet and in confidence is your might,” \qac ǁ\qac* And you have not been willing.
\v 16 And you say, “No, for we flee on a horse,” \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore you flee, \qac ǁ\qac* And, “We ride on the swift!” Therefore your pursuers are swift.
\v 17 One thousand [flee] because of the rebuke of one, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of the rebuke of five you flee, \qac ǁ\qac* Until you have surely been left as a pole \qac ǁ\qac* On the top of the mountain, \qac ǁ\qac* And as an ensign on the height.
\v 18 And therefore \nd Yhwh\nd* waits to favor you, \qac ǁ\qac* And therefore He is exalted to pity you, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] a God of judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* O the blessedness of all waiting for Him.
\v 19 For the people in Zion dwell in Jerusalem, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not weep—weeping, \qac ǁ\qac* Pitying, He pities you at the voice of your cry, \qac ǁ\qac* When He hears He answers you.
\v 20 And the Lord has given to you bread of adversity, \qac ǁ\qac* And water of oppression. And your teachers remove no longer, \qac ǁ\qac* And your eyes have seen your teachers,
\v 21 And your ear hears a word behind you, saying, “This [is] the way, go in it,” \qac ǁ\qac* When you turn to the right, \qac ǁ\qac* And when you turn to the left.
\v 22 And you have defiled the covering of Your carved images of silver, \qac ǁ\qac* And the ephod of your molten image of gold, \qac ǁ\qac* You scatter them as a sickening thing, “Go out,” you say to it.
\v 23 And He has given rain [for] your seed, \qac ǁ\qac* With which you sow the ground, \qac ǁ\qac* And bread, the increase of the ground, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been fat and plentiful, \qac ǁ\qac* Your livestock enjoy an enlarged pasture in that day.
\v 24 And the oxen and the young donkeys serving the ground, \qac ǁ\qac* Eat fermented provender, \qac ǁ\qac* That one is winnowing with shovel and fan.
\v 25 And there has been on every high mountain, \qac ǁ\qac* And on every exalted hill, \qac ǁ\qac* Streams—conduits of waters, \qac ǁ\qac* In a day of much slaughter, in the falling of towers.
\v 26 And the light of the moon has been as the light of the sun, \qac ǁ\qac* And the light of the sun is sevenfold, \qac ǁ\qac* As the light of seven days, \qac ǁ\qac* In the day of \nd Yhwh\nd*’s binding up the breach of His people, \qac ǁ\qac* When He heals the stroke of its wound.
\v 27 Behold, the Name of \nd Yhwh\nd* is coming from far, \qac ǁ\qac* His anger is burning, and the flame [is] great, \qac ǁ\qac* His lips have been full of indignation, \qac ǁ\qac* And His tongue [is] as a devouring fire.
\v 28 And His breath [is] as an overflowing stream, \qac ǁ\qac* It divides to the neck, \qac ǁ\qac* To sift nations with a sieve of vanity, \qac ǁ\qac* And a bridle causing to err, \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] on the jaws of the peoples.
\v 29 Singing is to you as in a night sanctified for a festival, \qac ǁ\qac* And joy of heart as he who is going with a pipe, \qac ǁ\qac* To go to the mountain of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* To the rock of Israel.
\v 30 And \nd Yhwh\nd* has caused \qac ǁ\qac* The splendor of His voice to be heard, \qac ǁ\qac* And the coming down of His arm \qac ǁ\qac* He shows with the raging of anger, \qac ǁ\qac* And the flame of a consuming fire, \qac ǁ\qac* Scattering, and inundation, and hailstone.
\v 31 For from the voice of \nd Yhwh\nd* Asshur [is] broken down, \qac ǁ\qac* He strikes with a rod.
\v 32 And every passage of the settled staff, \qac ǁ\qac* That \nd Yhwh\nd* causes to rest on him, \qac ǁ\qac* Has been with tambourines and with harps, \qac ǁ\qac* And in battles of shaking He has fought with it.
\v 33 For Tophet is arranged from former time, \qac ǁ\qac* Even it is prepared for the king, \qac ǁ\qac* He has made deep, \qac ǁ\qac* He has made large, \qac ǁ\qac* Its pile [is] fire and much wood, \qac ǁ\qac* The breath of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* As a stream of brimstone, is burning in it!
\c 31
\p
\v 1 Woe [to] those going down to Egypt for help, \qac ǁ\qac* And [who] lean on horses, \qac ǁ\qac* And trust on chariots, because [they are] many, \qac ǁ\qac* And on horsemen, because [they are] very strong, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not looked on the Holy One of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not sought \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 2 And He [is] also wise, and brings in evil, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has not turned aside His words, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has risen against a house of evildoers, \qac ǁ\qac* And against the help of workers of iniquity.
\v 3 And the Egyptians [are men], and not God, \qac ǁ\qac* And their horses [are] flesh, and not spirit, \qac ǁ\qac* And \nd Yhwh\nd* stretches out His hand, \qac ǁ\qac* And the helper has stumbled, \qac ǁ\qac* And the helped one has fallen, \qac ǁ\qac* And together all of them are consumed.
\v 4 For thus said \nd Yhwh\nd* to me: “As the lion and the young lion growl over his prey, \qac ǁ\qac* Against whom a multitude of shepherds is called, \qac ǁ\qac* He is not frightened from their voice, \qac ǁ\qac* And he is not humbled from their noise; So \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts comes down \qac ǁ\qac* To war on Mount Zion, and on her height.
\v 5 As birds flying, so does \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts \qac ǁ\qac* Cover over Jerusalem, covering and delivering, \qac ǁ\qac* Passing over, and causing to escape.”
\v 6 Turn back to Him from whom sons of Israel \qac ǁ\qac* Have deepened apostasy.
\v 7 For in that day each despises His idols of silver, and his idols of gold, \qac ǁ\qac* That your hands made to you—a sin.
\v 8 And Asshur has fallen by sword, not of the high, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, a sword—not of the low, consumes him, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has fled for himself from the face of a sword, \qac ǁ\qac* And his young men become tributary.
\v 9 And he passes on [to] his rock from fear, \qac ǁ\qac* And his princes have been frightened by the ensign—a declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Who has a light in Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* And who has a furnace in Jerusalem!
\c 32
\p
\v 1 Behold, a king reigns for righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* As for princes, they rule for judgment.
\v 2 And each has been as a hiding place [from] wind, \qac ǁ\qac* And as a secret hiding place [from] inundation, \qac ǁ\qac* As streams of waters in a dry place, \qac ǁ\qac* As a shadow of a heavy rock in a weary land.
\v 3 And the eyes of beholders are not dazzled, \qac ǁ\qac* And the ears of hearers attend.
\v 4 And the heart of those hurried understands to know, \qac ǁ\qac* And the tongue of stammerers hurries to speak clearly.
\v 5 A fool is no more called “noble,” \qac ǁ\qac* And to a miser it is not said, “rich”;
\v 6 For a fool speaks folly, \qac ǁ\qac* And his heart does iniquity, to do profanity, \qac ǁ\qac* And to speak error concerning \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* To empty the soul of the hungry, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, he causes the thirsty to lack [their] drink.
\v 7 And the miser—his instruments [are] evil, \qac ǁ\qac* He has counseled wicked schemes, \qac ǁ\qac* To corrupt the poor with lying sayings, \qac ǁ\qac* Even when the needy speaks justly.
\v 8 And the noble counseled noble things, \qac ǁ\qac* And he rises up for noble things.
\v 9 Women, easy ones, rise, hear my voice, \qac ǁ\qac* Daughters, confident ones, give ear [to] my saying,
\v 10 In days and a year \qac ǁ\qac* You are troubled, O confident ones, \qac ǁ\qac* For harvest has been consumed, \qac ǁ\qac* The gathering does not come.
\v 11 Tremble, you women, you easy ones, \qac ǁ\qac* Be troubled, you confident ones, \qac ǁ\qac* Strip and make bare, with a girdle on the loins,
\v 12 They are lamenting for breasts, \qac ǁ\qac* For fields of desire, for the fruitful vine.
\v 13 Over the ground of my people thorn [and] brier go up, \qac ǁ\qac* Surely over all houses of joy of the exulting city,
\v 14 The palace has been left, \qac ǁ\qac* The multitude of the city forsaken, \qac ǁ\qac* Fort and watchtower have been for dens for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* A joy of wild donkeys—a pasture of herds;
\v 15 Until the Spirit is emptied out on us from on high, \qac ǁ\qac* And a wilderness has become a fruitful field, \qac ǁ\qac* And the fruitful field is reckoned for a forest.
\v 16 And judgment has dwelt in the wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* And righteousness remains in the fruitful field.
\v 17 And a work of the righteousness has been peace, \qac ǁ\qac* And a service of the righteousness—Keeping quiet and confidence for all time.
\v 18 And My people have dwelt in a peaceful habitation, \qac ǁ\qac* And in steadfast dwelling places, \qac ǁ\qac* And in quiet resting places.
\v 19 And it has hailed in the going down of the forest, \qac ǁ\qac* And the city is low in the valley.
\v 20 Blessed [are] you sowing by all waters, \qac ǁ\qac* Sending forth the foot of the ox and the donkey!
\c 33
\p
\v 1 Woe, spoiler! And you not spoiled, \qac ǁ\qac* And treacherous! And they did not deal treacherously with you, \qac ǁ\qac* When you finish, O spoiler, you are spoiled, \qac ǁ\qac* When you finish dealing treacherously, \qac ǁ\qac* They deal treacherously with you.
\v 2 O \nd Yhwh\nd*, favor us, \qac ǁ\qac* We have waited for You, \qac ǁ\qac* Be their arm, in the mornings, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, our salvation in time of adversity.
\v 3 From the voice of a multitude peoples have fled, \qac ǁ\qac* From Your exaltation nations have been scattered.
\v 4 And Your spoil has been gathered, \qac ǁ\qac* A gathering of the caterpillar, \qac ǁ\qac* As a running to and fro of locusts \qac ǁ\qac* He is running on it.
\v 5 \nd Yhwh\nd* is set on high, for He is dwelling on high, \qac ǁ\qac* He filled Zion [with] judgment and righteousness,
\v 6 And has been the steadfastness of your times, \qac ǁ\qac* The strength of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge, \qac ǁ\qac* Fear of \nd Yhwh\nd*—it [is] His treasure.
\v 7 Behold, “Their Ariel,” they have cried outside, \qac ǁ\qac* Messengers of peace weep bitterly.
\v 8 Highways have been desolated, \qac ǁ\qac* He who passes along the path has ceased, \qac ǁ\qac* He has broken covenant, \qac ǁ\qac* He has despised enemies, \qac ǁ\qac* He has not esteemed a man.
\v 9 The land has mourned, languished, \qac ǁ\qac* Lebanon has been confounded, \qac ǁ\qac* Sharon has been withered as a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* And Bashan and Carmel are shaking.
\v 10 Now I arise, says \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Now I am exalted, now I am lifted up.
\v 11 You conceive chaff, you bear stubble; Your spirit—a fire [that] devours you.
\v 12 And peoples have been [as] burnings of lime, \qac ǁ\qac* Thorns, as sweepings, they burn with fire.
\v 13 Hear, you far off, that which I have done, \qac ǁ\qac* And know, you near ones, My might.
\v 14 Sinners have been afraid in Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* Trembling has seized the profane: Who dwells for us—consuming fire, \qac ǁ\qac* Who dwells for us—burnings of the age?
\v 15 Whoever is walking righteously, \qac ǁ\qac* And is speaking uprightly, \qac ǁ\qac* Kicking against gain of oppressions, \qac ǁ\qac* Shaking his hands from taking hold on a bribe, \qac ǁ\qac* Stopping his ear from hearing of blood, \qac ǁ\qac* And shutting his eyes from looking on evil,
\v 16 He inhabits high places, \qac ǁ\qac* Strongholds of rock [are] his high tower, \qac ǁ\qac* His bread has been given, his waters steadfast.
\v 17 Your eyes see a king in his beauty, \qac ǁ\qac* They see a far-off land.
\v 18 Your heart meditates [on] terror, \qac ǁ\qac* Where [is] he who is counting? Where [is] he who is weighing? Where [is] he who is counting the towers?
\v 19 You do not see the strong people, \qac ǁ\qac* A people deeper of lip than to be understood, \qac ǁ\qac* Of a scorned tongue, there is no understanding.
\v 20 See Zion, the city of our meetings, \qac ǁ\qac* Your eyes see Jerusalem—a quiet habitation, \qac ǁ\qac* A tent not taken down, its pins are not removed forever, \qac ǁ\qac* And none of its cords are broken.
\v 21 But \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] mighty for us there, \qac ǁ\qac* A place of rivers—streams of broad sides, \qac ǁ\qac* No ship with oars goes into it, \qac ǁ\qac* And a mighty ship does not pass over it.
\v 22 For \nd Yhwh\nd*, ours who is judging, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* our lawgiver, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* our King—He saves us.
\v 23 Your ropes have been left, \qac ǁ\qac* They do not correctly strengthen their mast, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not spread out a sail, \qac ǁ\qac* Then a prey of much spoil has been apportioned, \qac ǁ\qac* The lame have taken spoil.
\v 24 Nor does an inhabitant say, “I was sick”; The people dwelling in it [are] forgiven of [their] iniquity!
\c 34
\p
\v 1 Come near, you nations, to hear, \qac ǁ\qac* And you peoples, give attention, \qac ǁ\qac* The earth and its fullness hear, \qac ǁ\qac* The world, and all its productions.
\v 2 For to \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] wrath against all the nations, \qac ǁ\qac* And fury against all their host, \qac ǁ\qac* He has devoted them to destruction, \qac ǁ\qac* He has given them to slaughter.
\v 3 And their wounded are cast out, \qac ǁ\qac* And their carcasses cause their stench to ascend, \qac ǁ\qac* And mountains have been melted from their blood.
\v 4 And all the host of the heavens have been consumed, \qac ǁ\qac* And the heavens have been rolled together as a scroll, \qac ǁ\qac* And all their hosts fade, \qac ǁ\qac* As the fading of a leaf of a vine, \qac ǁ\qac* And as the fading one of a fig tree.
\v 5 For My sword was soaked in the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, it comes down on Edom, \qac ǁ\qac* On the people of My curse for judgment.
\v 6 A sword [is] to \nd Yhwh\nd*—it has been full of blood, \qac ǁ\qac* It has been made fat with fatness, \qac ǁ\qac* With blood of lambs and male goats. With fat of kidneys of rams, \qac ǁ\qac* For to \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] a sacrifice in Bozrah, \qac ǁ\qac* And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
\v 7 And reems have come down with them, \qac ǁ\qac* And bullocks with bulls, \qac ǁ\qac* And their land has been soaked from blood, \qac ǁ\qac* And their dust is made fat from fatness.
\v 8 (For a day of vengeance [is] to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* A year of recompenses for Zion’s strife),
\v 9 And her streams have been turned to pitch, \qac ǁ\qac* And her dust to brimstone, \qac ǁ\qac* And her land has become burning pitch.
\v 10 She is not quenched by night and by day, \qac ǁ\qac* Her smoke goes up for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* She is desolate from generation to generation, \qac ǁ\qac* Forever and ever, none is passing into her.
\v 11 And pelican and hedgehog possess her, \qac ǁ\qac* And owl and raven dwell in her, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has stretched out over her \qac ǁ\qac* A line of vacancy, and stones of emptiness.
\v 12 They call her nobles [to] the kingdom, \qac ǁ\qac* But there are none there, \qac ǁ\qac* And all her princes are at an end.
\v 13 And thorns have gone up her palaces, \qac ǁ\qac* Nettle and bramble [are] in her fortresses, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been a habitation of dragons, \qac ǁ\qac* A court for daughters of an ostrich.
\v 14 And desert-dwellers have met with howlers, \qac ǁ\qac* And the goat calls for its companion, \qac ǁ\qac* Surely the night-owl has rested there, \qac ǁ\qac* And has found a place of rest for herself.
\v 15 The owl has made her nest there, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, she lays, and has hatched, \qac ǁ\qac* And has gathered under her shadow, \qac ǁ\qac* Surely vultures have been gathered there, \qac ǁ\qac* Each with its companion.
\v 16 Seek out of the scroll of \nd Yhwh\nd*, and read, \qac ǁ\qac* One of these has not been lacking, \qac ǁ\qac* None has missed its companion, \qac ǁ\qac* For My mouth—it has commanded, \qac ǁ\qac* And His Spirit—He has gathered them.
\v 17 And He has cast a lot for them, \qac ǁ\qac* And His hand has apportioned [it] to them by line, \qac ǁ\qac* They possess it for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* They dwell in it from generation to generation!
\c 35
\p
\v 1 They rejoice from the wilderness and dry place, \qac ǁ\qac* And the desert rejoices, \qac ǁ\qac* And flourishes as the rose,
\v 2 Flourishing it flourishes, and rejoices, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, [with] joy and singing, \qac ǁ\qac* The glory of Lebanon has been given to it, \qac ǁ\qac* The beauty of Carmel and Sharon, \qac ǁ\qac* They see the glory of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* The majesty of our God.
\v 3 Strengthen the feeble hands, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, strengthen the stumbling knees.
\v 4 Say to the hurried of heart, “Be strong, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not fear, behold, your God; vengeance comes, \qac ǁ\qac* The repayment of God, \qac ǁ\qac* He Himself comes and saves you.”
\v 5 Then eyes of the blind are opened, \qac ǁ\qac* And ears of the deaf are unstopped,
\v 6 Then the lame leap as a deer, \qac ǁ\qac* And the tongue of the mute sings, \qac ǁ\qac* For waters have been broken up in a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* And streams in a desert.
\v 7 And the mirage has become a pond, \qac ǁ\qac* And the thirsty land—fountains of waters, \qac ǁ\qac* In the habitation of dragons, \qac ǁ\qac* Its place of lying down, \qac ǁ\qac* A court for reed and rush.
\v 8 And a highway has been there, and a way, \qac ǁ\qac* And it is called the “Way of Holiness.” The unclean do not pass over it, \qac ǁ\qac* And He Himself [is] by them, \qac ǁ\qac* Whoever is going in the way—even fools do not err.
\v 9 No lion is there, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, a destructive beast does not ascend it, \qac ǁ\qac* It is not found there, \qac ǁ\qac* And the redeemed have walked,
\v 10 And the ransomed of \nd Yhwh\nd* return, \qac ǁ\qac* And have entered Zion with singing, \qac ǁ\qac* And [with] continuous joy on their head, \qac ǁ\qac* They attain joy and gladness, \qac ǁ\qac* And sorrow and sighing have fled away!
\c 36
\p
\v 1 And it comes to pass, in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Asshur has come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and seizes them.
\v 2 And the king of Asshur sends Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah, with a heavy force, and he stands by the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller’s field,
\v 3 and Eliakim son of Hilkiah goes forth to him, who [is] over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the remembrancer.
\v 4 And Rabshakeh says to them, “Now say to Hezekiah, Thus said the great king, the king of Asshur: What [is] this confidence in which you have confided?
\v 5 I have said, Only a word of the lips! Counsel and might [are] for battle. Now, on whom have you trusted, that you have rebelled against me?
\v 6 Behold, you have trusted on the staff of this broken reed—on Egypt—which a man leans on, and it has gone into his hand, and pierced it—so [is] Pharaoh king of Egypt to all those trusting on him.
\v 7 And do you say to me, We have trusted in our God \nd Yhwh\nd*? Is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has turned aside, and says to Judah and to Jerusalem, Bow yourselves before this altar?
\v 8 And now, please negotiate with my lord the king of Asshur, and I give two thousand horses to you, if you are able to put riders on them for yourself.
\v 9 And how do you turn back the face of one captain of the least of the servants of my lord, and trust on Egypt for yourself, for chariot and for horsemen?
\v 10 And now, without \nd Yhwh\nd* have I come up against this land to destroy it? \nd Yhwh\nd* said to me, Go up to this land, and you have destroyed it.”
\v 11 And Eliakim says—and Shebna and Joah—to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants [in] Aramaic, for we are understanding; and do not speak to us [in] Jewish, in the ears of the people who [are] on the wall.”
\v 12 And Rabshakeh says, “To your lord, and to you, has my lord sent me to speak these words? Is it not for the men—those sitting on the wall to eat their own dung and to drink their own water with you?”
\v 13 And Rabshakeh stands and calls with a great voice [in] Jewish, and says, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Asshur—
\v 14 thus said the king: Do not let Hezekiah lift you up, for he is not able to deliver you;
\v 15 and do not let Hezekiah make you trust to \nd Yhwh\nd*, saying, \nd Yhwh\nd* certainly delivers us, this city is not given into the hand of the king of Asshur.
\v 16 Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus said the king of Asshur: Make a blessing with me, and come out to me, and each of you eat of his vine, and each of his fig tree, and each drink the waters of his own well,
\v 17 until my coming in, and I have taken you to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards;
\v 18 lest Hezekiah persuades you, saying, \nd Yhwh\nd* delivers us. Have the gods of the nations each delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Asshur?
\v 19 Where [are] the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where [are] the gods of Sepharvaim, that they have delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\v 20 Who among all the gods of these lands [are] they who have delivered their land out of my hand, that \nd Yhwh\nd* delivers Jerusalem out of my hand?”
\v 21 And they keep silent, and have not answered him a word, for a command of the king is, saying, “Do not answer him.”
\v 22 And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who [is] over the house, comes in, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the remembrancer, to Hezekiah, with torn garments, and they declare to him the words of Rabshakeh.
\c 37
\p
\v 1 And it comes to pass, at King Hezekiah’s hearing, that he tears his garments, and covers himself with sackcloth, and enters the house of \nd Yhwh\nd*,
\v 2 and sends Eliakim, who [is] over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and [the] elderly of the priests, covering themselves with sackcloth, to Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet,
\v 3 and they say to him, “Thus said Hezekiah: A day of distress, and rebuke, and despising, [is] this day; for sons have come to the birth, and there is not power to bear.
\v 4 It may be your God \nd Yhwh\nd* hears the words of Rabshakeh with which the king of Asshur his lord has sent him to reproach the living God, and has decided concerning the words that your God \nd Yhwh\nd* has heard, and you have lifted up prayer for the remnant that is found.”
\v 5 And the servants of King Hezekiah come to Isaiah,
\v 6 and Isaiah says to them, “Thus you say to your lord, Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Asshur have reviled Me.
\v 7 Behold, I am giving a spirit in him, and he has heard a report, and has turned back to his land, and I have caused him to fall by the sword in his land.”
\v 8 And Rabshakeh turns back and finds the king of Asshur fighting against Libnah, for he has heard that he has journeyed from Lachish.
\v 9 And he hears concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, saying, “He has come out to fight with you”; and he hears, and sends messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
\v 10 “Thus you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Do not let your God in whom you are trusting lift you up, saying, Jerusalem is not given into the hand of the king of Asshur.
\v 11 Behold, you have heard that which the kings of Asshur have done to all the lands—to devote them—and you are delivered!
\v 12 Did the gods of the nations deliver them whom my fathers destroyed—Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden, who [are] in Telassar?
\v 13 Where [is] the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?”
\v 14 And Hezekiah takes the letters out of the hand of the messengers, and reads them, and Hezekiah goes up to the house of \nd Yhwh\nd*, and Hezekiah spreads it before \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 15 And Hezekiah prays to \nd Yhwh\nd*, saying,
\v 16 “\nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts, God of Israel, inhabiting the cherubim, You [are] God Himself—You alone—to all kingdoms of the earth, You have made the heavens and the earth.
\v 17 Incline, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, Your ear, and hear; open, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, Your eyes and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib that he has sent to reproach the living God.
\v 18 Truly, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, kings of Asshur have laid waste all the lands and their land,
\v 19 so as to put their gods into fire—for they [are] no gods, but work of the hands of man, wood and stone—and they destroy them.
\v 20 And now, our God \nd Yhwh\nd*, save us from his hand, and all kingdoms of the earth know that You [are] \nd Yhwh\nd*, You alone.”
\v 21 And Isaiah son of Amoz sends to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, God of Israel: That which you have prayed to Me concerning Sennacherib king of Asshur—
\v 22 this [is] the word that \nd Yhwh\nd* spoke concerning him: Trampled on you, laughed at you, \qac ǁ\qac* Has the virgin daughter of Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken the head behind you.
\v 23 Whom have you reproached and reviled? And against whom—lifted up the voice? Indeed, you lift up your eyes on high \qac ǁ\qac* Against the Holy One of Israel.
\v 24 By the hand of your servants \qac ǁ\qac* You have reviled the Lord, and say: In the multitude of my chariots \qac ǁ\qac* I have come up to a high place of hills, \qac ǁ\qac* The sides of Lebanon, \qac ǁ\qac* And I cut down the height of its cedars, \qac ǁ\qac* The choice of its firs, \qac ǁ\qac* And I enter the high place of its extremity, \qac ǁ\qac* The forest of its Carmel.
\v 25 I have dug and drunk waters, \qac ǁ\qac* And I dry up with the sole of my steps \qac ǁ\qac* All floods of a bulwark.
\v 26 Have you not heard from afar [that] I did it, \qac ǁ\qac* From days of old—that I formed it? Now I have brought it in, \qac ǁ\qac* And it is to make desolate, \qac ǁ\qac* Ruinous heaps—fortified cities,
\v 27 And their inhabitants are feeble-handed, \qac ǁ\qac* They were broken down, and are dried up. They have been the herb of the field, \qac ǁ\qac* And the greenness of the tender grass, \qac ǁ\qac* Grass of the roofs, \qac ǁ\qac* And blasted grain, before it has risen up.
\v 28 And your sitting down, and your going out, \qac ǁ\qac* And your coming in, I have known, \qac ǁ\qac* And your anger toward Me.
\v 29 Because of your anger toward Me, \qac ǁ\qac* And your noise—it came up into My ears, \qac ǁ\qac* I have put My hook in your nose, \qac ǁ\qac* And My bridle in your lips, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have caused you to turn back \qac ǁ\qac* In the way in which you came.
\v 30 And this [is] the sign to you, \qac ǁ\qac* Self-sown grain [is] food of the year, \qac ǁ\qac* And in the second year the spontaneous growth, \qac ǁ\qac* And in the third year, sow and reap, \qac ǁ\qac* And plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
\v 31 And it has continued—The escaped of the house of Judah that has been left—To take root beneath, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has made fruit upward.
\v 32 For a remnant goes forth from Jerusalem, \qac ǁ\qac* And an escape from Mount Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* The zeal of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts does this.
\v 33 Therefore, thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Concerning the king of Asshur: He does not come into this city, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor does he shoot an arrow there, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor does he come before it [with] shield, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor does he pour out a mound against it.
\v 34 In the way that he came, in it he turns back, \qac ǁ\qac* And to this city he does not come in, \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*,
\v 35 And I have covered over this city, \qac ǁ\qac* To save it, for My own sake, \qac ǁ\qac* And for the sake of My servant David.”
\v 36 And a messenger of \nd Yhwh\nd* goes out, and strikes in the camp of Asshur one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and [men] rise early in the morning, and behold, all of them [are] dead corpses.
\v 37 And he journeys, and goes, and Sennacherib king of Asshur turns back, and dwells in Nineveh.
\v 38 And it comes to pass, he is bowing himself in the house of his god Nisroch, and his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer have struck him with the sword, and they have escaped to the land of Ararat, and his son Esar-Haddon reigns in his stead.
\c 38
\p
\v 1 In those days has Hezekiah been sick to death, and Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet, comes to him and says to him, “Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*: Give a charge to your house, for you [are] dying, and do not live.”
\v 2 And Hezekiah turns around his face to the wall, and prays to \nd Yhwh\nd*,
\v 3 and says, “Ah, now, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, please remember how I have habitually walked before You in truth, and with a perfect heart, and I have done that which [is] good in your eyes”; and Hezekiah weeps [with] a great weeping.
\v 4 And a word of \nd Yhwh\nd* is to Isaiah, saying,
\v 5 “Go, and you have said to Hezekiah, Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, God of your father David: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tear, behold, I am adding fifteen years to your days,
\v 6 and out of the hand of the king of Asshur I deliver you and this city, and have covered over this city.
\v 7 And this [is] to you the sign from \nd Yhwh\nd*, that \nd Yhwh\nd* does this thing that He has spoken.
\v 8 Behold, I am bringing back the shadow of the degrees that it has gone down on the degrees of Ahaz, by the sun, backward ten degrees”; and the sun turns back ten degrees in the degrees that it had gone down.
\v 9 A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah concerning his being sick when he revives from his sickness:
\v 10 “I said in the cutting off of my days, \qac ǁ\qac* I go to the gates of Sheol, \qac ǁ\qac* I have numbered the remnant of my years.
\v 11 I said, I do not see \nd Yah\nd*—\nd Yah\nd*! In the land of the living, \qac ǁ\qac* I do not behold man anymore, \qac ǁ\qac* With the inhabitants of the world.
\v 12 My sojourning has departed, \qac ǁ\qac* And been removed from me as a shepherd’s tent, \qac ǁ\qac* I have drawn together, as a weaver, my life, \qac ǁ\qac* By weakness it cuts me off, \qac ǁ\qac* From day to night You end me.
\v 13 I have set [Him] as a lion until morning, \qac ǁ\qac* So He breaks all my bones, \qac ǁ\qac* From day to night You end me.
\v 14 As a crane—a swallow—so I chatter, \qac ǁ\qac* I mourn as a dove, \qac ǁ\qac* My eyes have been drawn up on high, \qac ǁ\qac* O \nd Yhwh\nd*, oppression [is] on me, be my guarantor.
\v 15 What do I say? Seeing He spoke to me, \qac ǁ\qac* And He Himself has worked, \qac ǁ\qac* I go softly all my years for the bitterness of my soul.
\v 16 Lord, [men] live by these, \qac ǁ\qac* And by all in them [is] the life of my spirit, \qac ǁ\qac* And You save me, make me to also live,
\v 17 Behold, He changed bitterness to peace for me, \qac ǁ\qac* And You have delighted in my soul without corruption, \qac ǁ\qac* For You have cast all my sins behind Your back.
\v 18 For Sheol does not confess You, \qac ǁ\qac* Death does not praise You, \qac ǁ\qac* Those going down to the pit do not hope for Your truth.
\v 19 The living, the living, he confesses You,
\v 20 Like myself today; A father makes known to [his] sons of Your faithfulness, \qac ǁ\qac* O \nd Yhwh\nd*—to save me: And we sing my songs all [the] days of our lives \qac ǁ\qac* In the house of \nd Yhwh\nd*.”
\v 21 And Isaiah says, “Let them take a bunch of figs, and plaster over the ulcer, and he lives.”
\v 22 And Hezekiah says, “What [is] the sign that I go up to the house of \nd Yhwh\nd*?”
\c 39
\p
\v 1 At that time, Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, has sent letters and a present to Hezekiah when he hears that he has been sick and has become strong.
\v 2 And Hezekiah rejoices over them, and shows them the house of his spices, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the good ointment, and all the house of his vessels, and all that has been found in his treasures; there has not been a thing in his house, and in all his dominion, that Hezekiah has not showed them.
\v 3 And Isaiah the prophet comes to King Hezekiah and says to him, “What did these men say? And from where do they come to you?” And Hezekiah says, “They have come to me from a far-off land—from Babylon.”
\v 4 And he says, “What did they see in your house?” And Hezekiah says, “They saw all that [is] in my house; there has not been a thing that I have not showed them among my treasures.”
\v 5 And Isaiah says to Hezekiah, “Hear a word of \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts:
\v 6 Behold, days are coming, and all that [is] in your house, and that your fathers have treasured up until this day, has been carried to Babylon; there is not a thing left, said \nd Yhwh\nd*;
\v 7 and of your sons who come forth from you, whom you beget, they take, and they have been eunuchs in a palace of the king of Babylon.”
\v 8 And Hezekiah says to Isaiah, “The word of \nd Yhwh\nd* that you have spoken [is] good”; and he says, “Because there is peace and truth in my days.”
\c 40
\p
\v 1 “Comfort, comfort My people,” says your God.
\v 2 Speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and call to her, \qac ǁ\qac* That her warfare has been completed, \qac ǁ\qac* That her punishment has been accepted, \qac ǁ\qac* That she has received from the hand of \nd Yhwh\nd* \qac ǁ\qac* Double for all her sins.
\v 3 A voice is crying in a wilderness: “Prepare the way of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Make straight in a desert a highway for our God.
\v 4 Every valley is raised up, \qac ǁ\qac* And every mountain and hill become low, \qac ǁ\qac* And the crooked place has become a plain, \qac ǁ\qac* And the entangled places a valley.
\v 5 And the glory of \nd Yhwh\nd* has been revealed, \qac ǁ\qac* And all flesh have seen [it] together, \qac ǁ\qac* For the mouth of \nd Yhwh\nd* has spoken.”
\v 6 A voice is saying, “Call,” \qac ǁ\qac* And he said, “What do I call?” All flesh [is] grass, and all its goodness \qac ǁ\qac* [Is] as a flower of the field:
\v 7 Grass has withered, the flower faded, \qac ǁ\qac* For the Spirit of \nd Yhwh\nd* blew on it, \qac ǁ\qac* Surely the people [is] grass;
\v 8 Grass has withered, the flower faded, \qac ǁ\qac* But a word of our God rises forever.
\v 9 Get up on a high mountain, O Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* Proclaiming tidings, \qac ǁ\qac* Lift up your voice with power, O Jerusalem, proclaiming tidings, \qac ǁ\qac* Lift up, do not fear, say to cities of Judah, “Behold, your God.”
\v 10 Behold, Lord \nd Yhwh\nd* comes with strength, \qac ǁ\qac* And His arm is ruling for Him, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, His hire [is] with Him, and His wage before Him.
\v 11 He feeds His flock as a shepherd, \qac ǁ\qac* He gathers lambs with His arm, \qac ǁ\qac* And He carries [them] in His bosom: He leads suckling ones.
\v 12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, \qac ǁ\qac* And has meted out the heavens by a span, \qac ǁ\qac* And comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, \qac ǁ\qac* And has weighed the mountains in scales, \qac ǁ\qac* And the hills in a balance?
\v 13 Who has meted out the Spirit of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And [being] His counselor, teaches Him?
\v 14 With whom [did] He consult, \qac ǁ\qac* That he causes Him to understand? And teaches Him in the path of judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* And teaches Him knowledge? And causes Him to know the way of understanding?
\v 15 Behold, nations [are] as a drop from a bucket, \qac ǁ\qac* And have been reckoned as small dust of the balance, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, He takes up islands as a small thing.
\v 16 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor its beasts sufficient for a burnt-offering.
\v 17 All the nations [are] as nothing before Him, \qac ǁ\qac* Less than nothing and emptiness, \qac ǁ\qac* They have been reckoned to Him.
\v 18 And to whom do you liken God, \qac ǁ\qac* And what likeness do you compare to Him?
\v 19 An artisan has poured out the carved image, \qac ǁ\qac* And a refiner spreads it over with gold, \qac ǁ\qac* And he is refining chains of silver.
\v 20 He who is poor [by] raised-offerings, \qac ǁ\qac* Chooses a tree [that is] not rotten, \qac ǁ\qac* He seeks a skillful artisan for it, \qac ǁ\qac* To establish a carved image—not moved.
\v 21 Do you not know—do you not hear? Has it not been declared from the first to you? Have you not understood \qac ǁ\qac* [From] the foundations of the earth?
\v 22 He who is sitting on the circle of the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And its inhabitants [are] as grasshoppers, \qac ǁ\qac* He who is stretching out the heavens as a thin thing, \qac ǁ\qac* And spreads them as a tent to dwell in.
\v 23 He who is making princes become nothing, \qac ǁ\qac* Has made judges of earth formless;
\v 24 Indeed, they have not been planted, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, they have not been sown, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, their stock is not taking root in the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has also blown on them, and they wither, \qac ǁ\qac* And a whirlwind takes them away as stubble.
\v 25 And to whom do you liken Me, \qac ǁ\qac* And [to whom] I equal? Says the Holy One.
\v 26 Lift up your eyes on high, \qac ǁ\qac* And see—who has created these? He who is bringing out their host by number, \qac ǁ\qac* He calls to all of them by name, \qac ǁ\qac* By the abundance of His strength \qac ǁ\qac* And mighty power, \qac ǁ\qac* Not one is lacking.
\v 27 Why say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, “My way has been hid from \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And from my God my judgment passes over?”
\v 28 Have you not known? Have you not heard? The God of the age—\nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Preparer of the ends of the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* Is not wearied nor fatigued, \qac ǁ\qac* There is no searching of His understanding.
\v 29 He is giving power to the weary, \qac ǁ\qac* And to those not strong He increases might.
\v 30 Even youths are wearied and fatigued, \qac ǁ\qac* And young men utterly stumble,
\v 31 But those expecting \nd Yhwh\nd* pass [to] power, \qac ǁ\qac* They raise up the pinion as eagles, \qac ǁ\qac* They run and are not fatigued, \qac ǁ\qac* They go on and do not faint!
\c 41
\p
\v 1 Keep silent toward Me, O islands, \qac ǁ\qac* And the peoples pass on [to] power, \qac ǁ\qac* They come near, then they speak, “Together we draw near to judgment.”
\v 2 Who stirred up a righteous one from the east? He calls him to His foot, \qac ǁ\qac* He gives nations before him, \qac ǁ\qac* And He causes him to rule kings, \qac ǁ\qac* He gives [them] as dust [to] his sword, \qac ǁ\qac* As driven stubble [to] his bow.
\v 3 He pursues them, he passes over in safety \qac ǁ\qac* A path he does not enter with his feet.
\v 4 Who has worked and done, \qac ǁ\qac* Calling the generations from the first? I, \nd Yhwh\nd*, the first, and with the last I [am] He.
\v 5 Islands have seen and fear, \qac ǁ\qac* The ends of the earth tremble, \qac ǁ\qac* They have drawn near, indeed, they come.
\v 6 They each help his neighbor, \qac ǁ\qac* And to his brother he says, “Be strong.”
\v 7 And an artisan strengthens the refiner, \qac ǁ\qac* A smoother [with] a hammer, \qac ǁ\qac* Him who is beating [on] an anvil, saying, “For joining it [is] good,” \qac ǁ\qac* And he strengthens it with nails, it is not moved!
\v 8 And you, O Israel, My servant, \qac ǁ\qac* Jacob, whom I have chosen, \qac ǁ\qac* Seed of Abraham, My lover,
\v 9 Whom I have taken hold of, from the ends of the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And from its near places I have called you, \qac ǁ\qac* And I say to you, You [are] My servant, \qac ǁ\qac* I have chosen you, and not rejected you.
\v 10 Do not be afraid, for I [am] with you, do not look around, for I [am] your God, \qac ǁ\qac* I have strengthened you, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, I have helped you, indeed, I upheld you, \qac ǁ\qac* With the right hand of My righteousness.
\v 11 Behold, all those displeased with you, \qac ǁ\qac* They are ashamed and blush, \qac ǁ\qac* They are as nothing, indeed, \qac ǁ\qac* The men who strive with you perish.
\v 12 You seek them, and do not find them, \qac ǁ\qac* The men who debate with you, \qac ǁ\qac* They are as nothing, indeed, as nothing, \qac ǁ\qac* The men who war with you.
\v 13 For I, your God \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Am strengthening your right hand, \qac ǁ\qac* He who is saying to you, “Do not fear, I have helped you.”
\v 14 Do not fear, O worm Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* You men of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* I helped you, a declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Even your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
\v 15 Behold, I have set you for a new sharp threshing instrument, \qac ǁ\qac* Possessing teeth, you thresh mountains, \qac ǁ\qac* And beat small, and make hills as chaff.
\v 16 You winnow them, and a wind lifts them up, \qac ǁ\qac* And a whirlwind scatters them, \qac ǁ\qac* And you rejoice in \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* [And] boast yourself in the Holy One of Israel.
\v 17 The poor and the needy are seeking water, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is none, \qac ǁ\qac* Their tongue has failed with thirst, \qac ǁ\qac* I, \nd Yhwh\nd*, answer them, \qac ǁ\qac* The God of Israel—I do not forsake them.
\v 18 I open rivers on high places, \qac ǁ\qac* And fountains in midst of valleys, \qac ǁ\qac* I make a wilderness become a pond of water, \qac ǁ\qac* And a dry land becomes springs of water.
\v 19 I give in a wilderness the cedar, \qac ǁ\qac* Shittah, and myrtle, and oil-tree, \qac ǁ\qac* I set in a desert the fir-pine and box-wood together.
\v 20 So that they see, and know, \qac ǁ\qac* And regard, and act wisely together, \qac ǁ\qac* For the hand of \nd Yhwh\nd* has done this, \qac ǁ\qac* And the Holy One of Israel has created it.
\v 21 Bring your cause near, says \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Bring your mighty ones near, says the King of Jacob.
\v 22 They bring [them] near, and declare to us that which happens, \qac ǁ\qac* Declare the first things—what they [are], \qac ǁ\qac* And we set our heart, and know their latter end, \qac ǁ\qac* Or cause us to hear the coming things.
\v 23 Declare the things that are coming hereafter, \qac ǁ\qac* And we know that you [are] gods, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, you may do good or do evil, \qac ǁ\qac* And we look around and see [it] together.
\v 24 Behold, you [are] of nothing, and your work of nothing, \qac ǁ\qac* An abomination—it fixes on you.
\v 25 I have stirred up [one] from the north, \qac ǁ\qac* And he comes, \qac ǁ\qac* From the rising of the sun he calls in My Name, \qac ǁ\qac* And he comes in [on] prefects as [on] clay, \qac ǁ\qac* And as a potter treads down mire.
\v 26 Who has declared from the first, and we know? And formerly, and we say, “Righteous?” Indeed, there is none declaring, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, there is none proclaiming, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, there is none hearing your sayings.
\v 27 First to Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, behold them, \qac ǁ\qac* And to Jerusalem I give one proclaiming tidings,
\v 28 And I see that there is no man, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, of these that there is no counselor, \qac ǁ\qac* And I ask them, and they return word:
\v 29 “Behold, all of them [are] vanity, \qac ǁ\qac* Their works [are] nothing, \qac ǁ\qac* Their molten images [are] wind and emptiness!”
\c 42
\p
\v 1 Behold, My servant, I take hold on Him, \qac ǁ\qac* My Chosen One—My soul has accepted, I have put My Spirit on Him, \qac ǁ\qac* He brings forth judgment to nations.
\v 2 He does not cry, nor lift up, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor cause His voice to be heard in the street.
\v 3 A bruised reed He does not break, \qac ǁ\qac* And faded flax He does not quench, \qac ǁ\qac* He brings forth judgment to truth.
\v 4 He does not become weak nor bruised, \qac ǁ\qac* Until He sets judgment in the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And islands wait with hope for His law.
\v 5 Thus said God, \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Creating the heavens, and stretching them out, \qac ǁ\qac* Spreading out the earth and its productions, \qac ǁ\qac* Giving breath to the people on it, \qac ǁ\qac* And spirit to those walking in it.
\v 6 I, \nd Yhwh\nd*, called you in righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And I lay hold on your hand, and keep you, \qac ǁ\qac* And I give you for a covenant of a people, \qac ǁ\qac* And a light of nations.
\v 7 To open the eyes of the blind, \qac ǁ\qac* To bring forth the bound one from prison, \qac ǁ\qac* Those sitting in darkness from the house of restraint.
\v 8 I [am] \nd Yhwh\nd*, this [is] My Name, \qac ǁ\qac* And I do not give My glory to another, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor My praise to carved images.
\v 9 The former things, behold, have come, \qac ǁ\qac* And I am declaring new things, \qac ǁ\qac* Before they spring up I cause you to hear.
\v 10 Sing a new song to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* His praise from the end of the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* You who are going down to the sea, and its fullness, \qac ǁ\qac* Islands, and their inhabitants.
\v 11 The wilderness and its cities lift up [their voice], \qac ǁ\qac* Kedar inhabits the villages, \qac ǁ\qac* The inhabitants of Sela sing, \qac ǁ\qac* They cry from the top of mountains.
\v 12 They ascribe to \nd Yhwh\nd* glory, \qac ǁ\qac* And they declare His praise in the islands.
\v 13 \nd Yhwh\nd* goes forth as a mighty one. He stirs up zeal as a man of war, \qac ǁ\qac* He cries, indeed, He shrieks, \qac ǁ\qac* He shows Himself mighty against His enemies.
\v 14 I have kept silent from of old, \qac ǁ\qac* I keep silent, I refrain Myself, \qac ǁ\qac* I cry out as a travailing woman, \qac ǁ\qac* I desolate and swallow up together.
\v 15 I make desolate mountains and hills, \qac ǁ\qac* And I dry up all their herbs, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have made rivers become islands, \qac ǁ\qac* And I dry up ponds.
\v 16 And I have caused the blind to go, \qac ǁ\qac* In a way they have not known, \qac ǁ\qac* I cause them to tread in paths they have not known, \qac ǁ\qac* I make a dark place become light before them, \qac ǁ\qac* And unleveled places become a plain, \qac ǁ\qac* These [are] the things I have done to them, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have not forsaken them.
\v 17 Removed backward—utterly ashamed, \qac ǁ\qac* Are those trusting in a carved image, \qac ǁ\qac* Those saying to a molten image, “You [are] our gods.”
\v 18 You deaf, hear; and you blind, look to see.
\v 19 Who [is] blind but My servant? And deaf as My messenger I send? Who [is] blind as he who is at peace, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, blind, as the servant of \nd Yhwh\nd*?
\v 20 Seeing many things, and you do not observe, \qac ǁ\qac* Opening ears, and he does not hear.
\v 21 \nd Yhwh\nd* has delight for the sake of His righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* He magnifies law, and makes honorable.
\v 22 And this [is] a people seized and spoiled, \qac ǁ\qac* Snared in holes—all of them, \qac ǁ\qac* And they were hidden in houses of restraint, \qac ǁ\qac* They have been for a prey, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is no deliverer, \qac ǁ\qac* A spoil, and none is saying, “Restore.”
\v 23 Who among you gives ear [to] this? Attends, and hears afterward?
\v 24 Who has given Jacob for a spoil, \qac ǁ\qac* And Israel to the spoilers? Is it not \nd Yhwh\nd*—He against whom we sinned? Indeed, they have not been willing to walk in His ways, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor have they listened to His law.
\v 25 And He pours fury on him, \qac ǁ\qac* His anger, and the strength of battle, \qac ǁ\qac* And it sets him on fire all around, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has not known, \qac ǁ\qac* And it burns against him, and he does not lay it to heart!
\c 43
\p
\v 1 And now, thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, Your Creator, O Jacob, and your Fashioner, O Israel: Do not be afraid, for I have redeemed you, \qac ǁ\qac* I have called on your name—you [are] Mine.
\v 2 When you pass into waters, I [am] with you, \qac ǁ\qac* And into floods, they do not overflow you, \qac ǁ\qac* When you go into fire, you are not burned, \qac ǁ\qac* And a flame does not burn against you.
\v 3 For I—your God \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* The Holy One of Israel, your Savior, \qac ǁ\qac* I have appointed Egypt your atonement, \qac ǁ\qac* Cush and Seba in your stead.
\v 4 Since you were precious in My eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* You were honored, and I have loved you, \qac ǁ\qac* And I appoint men in your stead, \qac ǁ\qac* And peoples instead of your life.
\v 5 Do not be afraid, for I [am] with you, \qac ǁ\qac* I bring in your seed from the east, \qac ǁ\qac* And I gather you from the west.
\v 6 I am saying to the north, “Give up,” \qac ǁ\qac* And to the south, “Do not restrain.” Bring in My sons from afar, \qac ǁ\qac* And My daughters from the end of the earth.
\v 7 Everyone who is called by My Name, \qac ǁ\qac* Even for My glory I have created him, \qac ǁ\qac* I have formed him, indeed, I have made him.
\v 8 He brought out a blind people who have eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* And deaf ones who have ears.
\v 9 All the nations have been gathered together, \qac ǁ\qac* And the peoples are assembled, \qac ǁ\qac* Who among them declares this, \qac ǁ\qac* And causes us to hear former things? They give their witnesses, \qac ǁ\qac* And they are declared righteous, \qac ǁ\qac* And they hear and say, “Truth.”
\v 10 You [are] My witnesses, a declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And My servant whom I have chosen, \qac ǁ\qac* So that you know and give credence to Me, \qac ǁ\qac* And understand that I [am] He, \qac ǁ\qac* Before Me there was no God formed, \qac ǁ\qac* And after Me there is none.
\v 11 I [am] \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And besides Me there is no savior.
\v 12 I declared, and saved, and proclaimed, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is no stranger with you, \qac ǁ\qac* And you [are] My witnesses, a declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And I [am] God.
\v 13 Even from the day I [am] He, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is no deliverer from My hand, \qac ǁ\qac* I work, and who turns it back?
\v 14 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, your Redeemer, \qac ǁ\qac* The Holy One of Israel: “I have sent to Babylon for your sake, \qac ǁ\qac* And caused bars to descend—all of them, \qac ǁ\qac* And the Chaldeans, whose song [is] in the ships.
\v 15 I [am] \nd Yhwh\nd*, your Holy One, \qac ǁ\qac* Creator of Israel, your King.”
\v 16 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is giving a way in the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* And a path in the strong waters.
\v 17 Who is bringing forth chariot and horse, \qac ǁ\qac* A force, even a strong one: “They lie down together—they do not rise, \qac ǁ\qac* They have been extinguished, \qac ǁ\qac* They have been quenched as flax.”
\v 18 Do not remember former things, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not consider ancient things.
\v 19 Behold, I am doing a new thing, now it springs up, \qac ǁ\qac* Do you not know it? Indeed, I put a way in a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* In a desolate place—floods.
\v 20 The beast of the field honors Me, \qac ǁ\qac* Dragons and daughters of an ostrich, \qac ǁ\qac* For I have given waters in a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* Floods in a desolate place, \qac ǁ\qac* To give drink to My people—My chosen.
\v 21 I have formed this people for Myself, \qac ǁ\qac* They recount My praise.
\v 22 And you have not called Me, O Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* For you have been wearied of Me, O Israel,
\v 23 You have not brought to Me, \qac ǁ\qac* The lamb of your burnt-offerings, \qac ǁ\qac* And [with] your sacrifices you have not honored Me, \qac ǁ\qac* I have not caused you to serve with a present, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor wearied you with frankincense.
\v 24 You have not bought Me sweet cane with money, \qac ǁ\qac* And have not filled Me [with] the fat of your sacrifices, \qac ǁ\qac* Only—you have caused Me to serve with your sins, \qac ǁ\qac* You have wearied Me with your iniquities.
\v 25 I [am] He who is blotting out Your transgressions for My own sake, \qac ǁ\qac* And I do not remember your sins.
\v 26 Cause Me to remember—we are judged together, \qac ǁ\qac* Declare that you may be justified.
\v 27 Your first father sinned, \qac ǁ\qac* And your interpreters transgressed against Me,
\v 28 And I defile princes of the sanctuary, \qac ǁ\qac* And I give Jacob to destruction, and Israel to revilings!
\c 44
\p
\v 1 “And now, hear, O Jacob, My servant, \qac ǁ\qac* And Israel, whom I have fixed on—
\v 2 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, your Maker, and your Former, \qac ǁ\qac* From the womb He helps you: Do not fear, My servant Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And Yeshurun, whom I have fixed on.
\v 3 For I pour waters on a thirsty one, \qac ǁ\qac* And floods on a dry land, \qac ǁ\qac* I pour My Spirit on your seed, \qac ǁ\qac* And My blessing on your offspring.
\v 4 And they have sprung up as among grass, \qac ǁ\qac* As willows by conduits of water.
\v 5 This [one] says, For I [am] \nd Yhwh\nd*’s, \qac ǁ\qac* And this calls [himself] by the name of Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And this [one] writes [with] his hand, For \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And surnames himself by the name of Israel.”
\v 6 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, King of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* And his Redeemer, \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts: “I [am] the first, and I [am] the last, \qac ǁ\qac* And besides Me there is no God.
\v 7 And who [is] as I, call and declare it, \qac ǁ\qac* And arrange it for Me, \qac ǁ\qac* Since My placing the people of antiquity, \qac ǁ\qac* And things that are coming, \qac ǁ\qac* And those that come, they declare to them.
\v 8 Do not fear, nor be afraid, \qac ǁ\qac* Have I not caused you to hear from that time, and declared? And you [are] My witnesses, \qac ǁ\qac* Is there a God besides Me? Indeed, there is none, \qac ǁ\qac* I have not known another Rock.”
\v 9 Framers of a carved image, all of them [are] emptiness, \qac ǁ\qac* And their desirable things do not profit, \qac ǁ\qac* And they [are] their own witnesses, \qac ǁ\qac* They do not see, nor know, that they may be ashamed.
\v 10 Who has formed a god, \qac ǁ\qac* And poured out a molten image—not profitable?
\v 11 Behold, all his companions are ashamed, \qac ǁ\qac* As for artisans—they [are] of men, \qac ǁ\qac* All of them gather together, they stand up, \qac ǁ\qac* They fear, they are ashamed together.
\v 12 He has worked iron [with] an axe, \qac ǁ\qac* And has worked with coals, \qac ǁ\qac* And forms it with hammers, \qac ǁ\qac* And works it by his powerful arm, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, he is hungry, and there is no power, \qac ǁ\qac* He does not drink water, and he is wearied.
\v 13 He has worked [with] wood, \qac ǁ\qac* He has stretched out a rule, \qac ǁ\qac* He marks it out with a line, \qac ǁ\qac* He makes it with carving tools, \qac ǁ\qac* And he marks it out with a compass, \qac ǁ\qac* And makes it according to the form of a man, \qac ǁ\qac* According to the beauty of a man, \qac ǁ\qac* To remain in the house.
\v 14 Cutting down cedars for himself, \qac ǁ\qac* He also takes a cypress, and an oak, \qac ǁ\qac* And he strengthens [it] for himself \qac ǁ\qac* Among the trees of a forest, \qac ǁ\qac* He has planted an ash, and the shower nourishes [it].
\v 15 And it has been for man to burn, \qac ǁ\qac* And he takes of them, and becomes warm, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, he kindles [it], and has baked bread, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, he makes a god, and bows himself, \qac ǁ\qac* He has made it a carved image, \qac ǁ\qac* And he falls down to it.
\v 16 Half of it he has burned in the fire, \qac ǁ\qac* By [this] half of it he eats flesh, \qac ǁ\qac* He roasts a roasting and is satisfied, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, he is warm and says: “Aha, I have become warm, I have enjoyed the light.”
\v 17 And he has made its remnant for a god—For his carved image, \qac ǁ\qac* He falls down to it, and worships, \qac ǁ\qac* And prays to it, and he says, “Deliver me, for you [are] my god.”
\v 18 They have not known, nor do they understand, \qac ǁ\qac* For He has coated their eyes from seeing, \qac ǁ\qac* Their heart from acting wisely.
\v 19 And none turn [it] back to his heart, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor has knowledge nor understanding to say, “I have burned half of it in the fire, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, I have also baked bread over its coals, \qac ǁ\qac* I roast flesh and I eat, \qac ǁ\qac* And I make its remnant for an abomination, \qac ǁ\qac* I fall down to the stock of a tree.”
\v 20 Feeding on ashes, the heart is deceived, \qac ǁ\qac* It has turned him aside, \qac ǁ\qac* And he does not deliver his soul, nor says: “Is there not a lie in my right hand?”
\v 21 “Remember these, O Jacob, and Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* For you [are] My servant, \qac ǁ\qac* I formed you, you [are] a servant to Me, \qac ǁ\qac* O Israel, you do not forget Me.
\v 22 I have blotted out, as [by] a thick cloud, \qac ǁ\qac* Your transgressions, \qac ǁ\qac* And as [by] a cloud, your sins, \qac ǁ\qac* Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.”
\v 23 Sing, O heavens, for \nd Yhwh\nd* has worked, \qac ǁ\qac* Shout, O lower parts of earth, \qac ǁ\qac* Break forth, O mountains, with singing, \qac ǁ\qac* Forest, and every tree in it, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* has redeemed Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And He beautifies Himself in Israel.
\v 24 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, your Redeemer, \qac ǁ\qac* And your Framer from the womb: “I [am] \nd Yhwh\nd*, doing all things, \qac ǁ\qac* Stretching out the heavens by Myself, \qac ǁ\qac* Spreading out the earth—who [is] with Me?
\v 25 Making void the tokens of devisers, \qac ǁ\qac* And makes diviners mad, \qac ǁ\qac* Turning the wise backward, \qac ǁ\qac* And makes their knowledge foolish.
\v 26 Confirming the word of His servant, \qac ǁ\qac* He perfects the counsel of His messengers, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is saying of Jerusalem, \qac ǁ\qac* She is inhabited, \qac ǁ\qac* And of cities of Judah, \qac ǁ\qac* They will be built, and her ruins I raise up,
\v 27 Who is saying to the deep, \qac ǁ\qac* Be dry, and your rivers I cause to dry up,
\v 28 Who is saying of Cyrus, My shepherd, \qac ǁ\qac* And he perfects all My delight, \qac ǁ\qac* So as to say of Jerusalem, You are built, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the temple, You are founded.”
\c 45
\p
\v 1 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* To His anointed, to Cyrus, \qac ǁ\qac* Whose right hand I have laid hold on, \qac ǁ\qac* To subdue nations before him, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, I loose loins of kings, \qac ǁ\qac* To open double doors before him, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, gates are not shut:
\v 2 “I go before you, and make crooked places straight, \qac ǁ\qac* I shatter doors of bronze, \qac ǁ\qac* And I cut bars of iron apart,
\v 3 And have given to you treasures of darkness, \qac ǁ\qac* Even treasures of secret places, \qac ǁ\qac* So that you know that I, \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Who am calling on your name—[am] the God of Israel.
\v 4 For the sake of My servant Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And of Israel My chosen, \qac ǁ\qac* I also call you by your name, I surname you, \qac ǁ\qac* And you have not known Me.
\v 5 I [am] \nd Yhwh\nd*, and there is none else, \qac ǁ\qac* There is no God except Me, \qac ǁ\qac* I gird you, and you have not known Me.
\v 6 So that they know from the rising of the sun, \qac ǁ\qac* And from the west, that there is none besides Me, \qac ǁ\qac* I [am] \nd Yhwh\nd*, and there is none else,
\v 7 Forming light, and creating darkness, \qac ǁ\qac* Making peace, and creating calamity, \qac ǁ\qac* I [am] \nd Yhwh\nd*, doing all these things.
\v 8 Drop, you heavens, from above, \qac ǁ\qac* And clouds cause righteousness to flow, \qac ǁ\qac* Earth opens, and they are fruitful, \qac ǁ\qac* Salvation and righteousness spring up together, \qac ǁ\qac* I, \nd Yhwh\nd*, have created it.
\v 9 Woe [to] him who is striving with his Former \qac ǁ\qac* (A potsherd with potsherds of the ground!) Does clay say to its Framer, What [are] you doing? And your work, He has no hands?
\v 10 Woe [to] him who is saying to a father, What do you beget? Or to a wife, What do you bring forth?”
\v 11 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, The Holy One of Israel, and his Former: “Ask Me of the things coming concerning My sons, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, concerning the work of My hands, you command Me.
\v 12 I made earth, and created man on it, \qac ǁ\qac* My hands stretched out the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have commanded all their host.
\v 13 I have stirred him up in righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And I make all his ways straight, \qac ǁ\qac* He builds My city, and sends out My captivity, \qac ǁ\qac* Not for price, nor for bribe,” said \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts.
\v 14 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*: “The labor of Egypt, \qac ǁ\qac* And the merchandise of Cush, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the Sebaim—men of measure, \qac ǁ\qac* Pass over to you, and they are yours, \qac ǁ\qac* They go after you, they pass over in chains, \qac ǁ\qac* And they bow themselves to you, \qac ǁ\qac* They pray to you: Surely God [is] in you, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is none else, no [other] God.”
\v 15 Surely You [are] a God hiding Yourself, God of Israel—Savior!
\v 16 They have been ashamed, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have even blushed—all of them, \qac ǁ\qac* Those carving images have gone together in confusion.
\v 17 Israel has been saved in \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* A perpetual salvation! You are not ashamed nor confounded \qac ǁ\qac* For all ages of eternity!
\v 18 For thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, Creator of the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* He is God, \qac ǁ\qac* Former of earth, and its Maker, \qac ǁ\qac* He established it—He did not create it empty, \qac ǁ\qac* For He formed it to be inhabited: “I [am] \nd Yhwh\nd*, and there is none else.
\v 19 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* I have not said to the seed of Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* Seek Me in vain, \qac ǁ\qac* I [am] \nd Yhwh\nd*, speaking righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* Declaring uprightness.
\v 20 Be gathered, and come in, \qac ǁ\qac* Come near together, you escaped of the nations, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not known, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are lifting up the wood of their carved image, \qac ǁ\qac* And praying to a god [that] does not save.
\v 21 Declare, and bring near, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, they take counsel together, \qac ǁ\qac* Who has proclaimed this from of old? [Who] has declared it from that time? Is it not I—\nd Yhwh\nd*? And there is no other god besides Me, \qac ǁ\qac* A God righteous and saving, there is none except Me.
\v 22 Turn to Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* For I [am] God, and there is none else.
\v 23 I have sworn by Myself, \qac ǁ\qac* A word has gone out from My mouth in righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And it does not return, \qac ǁ\qac* That to Me, every knee bows, every tongue swears.
\v 24 Only in \nd Yhwh\nd*, one has said, \qac ǁ\qac* Do I have righteousness and strength, \qac ǁ\qac* He comes to Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And all those displeased with Him are ashamed.
\v 25 In \nd Yhwh\nd* are all the seed of Israel justified, \qac ǁ\qac* And they boast themselves.”

\v 1 Bel has bowed down, Nebo is stooping, \qac ǁ\qac* Their idols have been for the beast and for livestock, \qac ǁ\qac* Your burdens are loaded, a burden to the weary.
\v 2 They have stooped, they have bowed together, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not been able to deliver the burden, \qac ǁ\qac* And have gone into captivity themselves.
\v 3 “Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And all the remnant of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are borne from the belly, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are carried from the womb,
\v 4 Even to old age, I [am] He, and to grey hairs I carry, \qac ǁ\qac* I made, and I bear, indeed, I carry and deliver.
\v 5 To whom do you liken Me, and make equal? And compare Me, that we may be like?
\v 6 They are pouring out gold from a bag, \qac ǁ\qac* And they weigh silver on the beam, \qac ǁ\qac* They hire a refiner, and he makes it a god, \qac ǁ\qac* They fall down, indeed, they bow themselves.
\v 7 They lift him up on the shoulder, \qac ǁ\qac* They carry him, and cause him to rest in his place, \qac ǁ\qac* And he stands, he does not move from his place, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, one cries to him, and he does not answer, \qac ǁ\qac* He does not save him from his adversity.
\v 8 Remember this, and show yourselves men, \qac ǁ\qac* Turn [it] back, O transgressors, to the heart.
\v 9 Remember former things of old, \qac ǁ\qac* For I [am] Mighty, and there is none else, \qac ǁ\qac* God—and there is none like Me.
\v 10 Declaring the latter end from the beginning, \qac ǁ\qac* And from of old that which has not been done, \qac ǁ\qac* Saying, My counsel stands, \qac ǁ\qac* And all My delight I do.
\v 11 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, \qac ǁ\qac* The man of My counsel from a far land, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, I have spoken, indeed, I bring it in, \qac ǁ\qac* I have formed [it], indeed, I do it.
\v 12 Listen to Me, you mighty in heart, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are far from righteousness.
\v 13 I have brought My righteousness near, \qac ǁ\qac* It is not far off, \qac ǁ\qac* And My salvation—it does not linger, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have given salvation in Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* For Israel My glory!”

\v 5 “Sit silent, and go into darkness, \qac ǁ\qac* O daughter of the Chaldeans, \qac ǁ\qac* For they no longer cry to you, Mistress of kingdoms.
\v 6 I have been angry against My people, I have defiled My inheritance \qac ǁ\qac* And I give them into your hand, \qac ǁ\qac* You have not appointed mercies for them, \qac ǁ\qac* You have made your yoke very heavy on the aged,
\v 7 And you say, I am mistress for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* While you have not laid these things to your heart, \qac ǁ\qac* You have not remembered the latter end of it.
\v 8 And now, hear this, O luxurious one, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is sitting confidently—Who is saying in her heart, I [am], and none else, \qac ǁ\qac* I do not sit [as] a widow, nor know bereavement.
\v 9 And these two things come to you, \qac ǁ\qac* In a moment, in one day: childlessness and widowhood, \qac ǁ\qac* They have come on you according to their perfection, \qac ǁ\qac* In the multitude of your sorceries, \qac ǁ\qac* In the exceeding might of your charms.
\v 10 And you are confident in your wickedness, \qac ǁ\qac* You have said, There is none seeing me, \qac ǁ\qac* Your wisdom and your knowledge, \qac ǁ\qac* It is turning you back, \qac ǁ\qac* And you say in your heart, I [am], and none else.

\v 12 Now stand in your charms, \qac ǁ\qac* And in the multitude of your sorceries, \qac ǁ\qac* In which you have labored from your youth, \qac ǁ\qac* It may be you are able to profit, \qac ǁ\qac* It may be you terrify!
\v 13 You have been wearied in the multitude of your counsels, \qac ǁ\qac* Now stand up and let them save you—The charmers of the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* Those looking on the stars, \qac ǁ\qac* Those teaching concerning the months—From those things that come on you!
\v 14 Behold, they have been as stubble! Fire has burned them, \qac ǁ\qac* They do not deliver themselves from the power of the flame, \qac ǁ\qac* There is not a coal to warm them, a light to sit before it.
\v 15 So they have been to you with whom you have labored, \qac ǁ\qac* Your merchants from your youth, \qac ǁ\qac* They have each wandered to his passage, \qac ǁ\qac* None is saving you!”

\v 1 “Hear this, O house of Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are called by the name of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* And from the waters of Judah came out, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are swearing by the Name of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And make mention of the God of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* Not in truth nor in righteousness.
\v 2 For they have been called from the Holy City, \qac ǁ\qac* And been supported on the God of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts [is] His Name.
\v 3 I declared the former things from that time, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have gone forth from My mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* And I proclaim them, \qac ǁ\qac* Suddenly I have done, and it comes.
\v 4 From My knowing that you are obstinate, \qac ǁ\qac* And your neck—a sinew of iron, \qac ǁ\qac* And your forehead—bronze,
\v 5 And from that time I declare [it] to you, \qac ǁ\qac* Before it comes I have caused you to hear, \qac ǁ\qac* Lest you say, My idol has done them, \qac ǁ\qac* And my carved image, \qac ǁ\qac* And my molten image commanded them.
\v 6 You have heard, see the whole of it, \qac ǁ\qac* And you, do you not declare? I have caused you to hear new things from this time, \qac ǁ\qac* And things reserved that you did not know.
\v 7 Now they have been produced and not from that time, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, before the day, and you have not heard them, \qac ǁ\qac* Lest you say, Behold, I have known them.
\v 8 Indeed, you have not heard, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, you have not known, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, your ear has not opened from that time, \qac ǁ\qac* For I have known you deal treacherously, \qac ǁ\qac* And [are] a transgressor from the belly, \qac ǁ\qac* One is crying to you.
\v 9 I defer My anger for My Name’s sake, \qac ǁ\qac* And [for] My praise I restrain for you, \qac ǁ\qac* So as not to cut you off.
\v 10 Behold, I have refined you, and not with silver, \qac ǁ\qac* I have chosen you in a furnace of affliction.
\v 11 For My sake, for My own sake, I do [it], \qac ǁ\qac* For how is it defiled? And I do not give My glory to another.
\v 12 Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, My called one, \qac ǁ\qac* I [am] He, \qac ǁ\qac* I [am] first, and I [am] last;
\v 13 Also, My hand has founded earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And My right hand stretched out the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* I am calling to them, they stand together.
\v 14 Be gathered, all of you, and hear, \qac ǁ\qac* Who among them declared these things? \nd Yhwh\nd* has loved him, \qac ǁ\qac* He does His pleasure on Babylon, \qac ǁ\qac* And His arm [is on] the Chaldeans.
\v 15 I have spoken, indeed, I have called him, I have brought him in, \qac ǁ\qac* And he has made his way prosperous.
\v 16 Come near to Me, hear this, \qac ǁ\qac* I have not spoken in secret from the beginning, \qac ǁ\qac* From the time of its being, I [am] there, \qac ǁ\qac* And now Lord \nd Yhwh\nd* has sent Me, and His Spirit.”
\v 17 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, your Redeemer, \qac ǁ\qac* The Holy One of Israel: “I [am] your God \nd Yhwh\nd*, teaching you to profit, \qac ǁ\qac* Causing you to tread in the way you go.
\v 18 O that you had attended to My commands, \qac ǁ\qac* Then your peace is as a river, \qac ǁ\qac* And your righteousness as billows of the sea,
\v 19 And your seed is as sand, \qac ǁ\qac* And the offspring of your bowels as gravel, \qac ǁ\qac* His name would not be cut off nor destroyed before Me.”
\v 20 Go out from Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans, \qac ǁ\qac* Declare with a voice of singing, \qac ǁ\qac* Cause this to be heard, \qac ǁ\qac* Bring it forth to the end of the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* Say, “\nd Yhwh\nd* has redeemed His servant Jacob.”
\v 21 And they have not thirsted in wastelands, \qac ǁ\qac* He has caused them to go on, \qac ǁ\qac* He has caused waters from a rock to flow to them, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, he cleaves a rock, and waters flow.
\v 22 “There is no peace,” said \nd Yhwh\nd*, “for the wicked!”
\c 49

\v 1 Listen, O islands, to Me, \qac ǁ\qac* And attend, O peoples, from afar, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* has called Me from the womb, \qac ǁ\qac* From the bowels of My mother \qac ǁ\qac* He has made mention of My Name.
\v 2 And He makes My mouth as a sharp sword, \qac ǁ\qac* He has hid Me in the shadow of His hand, \qac ǁ\qac* And He makes Me for a clear arrow, \qac ǁ\qac* He has hid Me in His quiver.
\v 3 And He says to me, “You are My servant, O Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* In whom I beautify Myself.”
\v 4 And I said, “I labored in vain, \qac ǁ\qac* I consumed my power for emptiness and vanity, \qac ǁ\qac* But my judgment [is] with \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And my wage with my God.”
\v 5 “And now,” said \nd Yhwh\nd*, who is forming Me from the belly—His Servant, \qac ǁ\qac* To bring Jacob back to Him \qac ǁ\qac* (Though Israel is not gathered, \qac ǁ\qac* Yet I am honored in the eyes of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And My God has been My strength).
\v 6 And He says, “It has been a light thing \qac ǁ\qac* That You are My Servant \qac ǁ\qac* To raise up the tribes of Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And to bring back the preserved of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have given You for a light to the nations, \qac ǁ\qac* To be My salvation to the end of the earth.”
\v 7 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*, Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, \qac ǁ\qac* To the despised in soul, \qac ǁ\qac* To the detested of a nation, \qac ǁ\qac* To the Servant of rulers: “Kings see, and have risen, princes, and worship, \qac ǁ\qac* For the sake of \nd Yhwh\nd*, who is faithful, \qac ǁ\qac* The Holy of Israel, and He chooses You.”
\v 8 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*: “In a time of good pleasure I answered You, \qac ǁ\qac* And in a day of salvation I helped You, \qac ǁ\qac* And I keep You, and give You, \qac ǁ\qac* For a covenant of the people, \qac ǁ\qac* To establish the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* To cause to inherit desolate inheritances.
\v 9 To say to the bound, Go out, \qac ǁ\qac* To those in darkness, Be uncovered. They feed on the ways, \qac ǁ\qac* And their pasture is in all high places.
\v 10 They do not hunger, nor thirst, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor do mirage and sun strike them, \qac ǁ\qac* For He who is pitying them leads them, \qac ǁ\qac* And tends them by fountains of waters.
\v 11 And I have made all My mountains for a way, \qac ǁ\qac* And My highways are lifted up.
\v 12 Behold, these come in from afar, \qac ǁ\qac* And behold, these from the north, and from the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* And these from the land of Sinim.”
\v 13 Sing, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And break forth, O mountains, with singing, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* has comforted His people, \qac ǁ\qac* And He pities His afflicted ones.
\v 14 And Zion says, “\nd Yhwh\nd* has forsaken me, \qac ǁ\qac* And my Lord has forgotten me.”
\v 15 “Does a woman forget her suckling, \qac ǁ\qac* The loved one—the son of her womb? Indeed, these forget—but I do not forget you.
\v 16 Behold, I have carved you on the palms of the hand, \qac ǁ\qac* Your walls [are] continually before Me.
\v 17 Those building you have hurried, \qac ǁ\qac* Those destroying you, and laying you waste, go out from you.
\v 18 Lift up your eyes, [look] around and see, \qac ǁ\qac* All of them have been gathered, \qac ǁ\qac* They have come to you. [As] I live,” a declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*! “Surely you put on all of them as an ornament, \qac ǁ\qac* And you bind them on like a bride.
\v 19 Because your ruins, and your desolate places, \qac ǁ\qac* And the land of your ruins, \qac ǁ\qac* Are now surely restricted because of inhabitants, \qac ǁ\qac* And those consuming you have been far off.
\v 20 Again the sons of your bereavement say in your ears: The place is too narrow for me, \qac ǁ\qac* Come near to me—and I dwell.
\v 21 And you have said in your heart: Who has begotten these for me? And I [am] bereaved and barren, \qac ǁ\qac* A captive, and turned aside, \qac ǁ\qac* And who has nourished these? Behold, I was left by myself, these—where [are] they from?”
\v 22 Thus said Lord \nd Yhwh\nd*: “Behold, I lift up My hand to nations, \qac ǁ\qac* And I raise up My ensign to peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have brought your sons in the bosom, \qac ǁ\qac* And your daughters are carried on the shoulder.
\v 23 And kings have been your nursing fathers, \qac ǁ\qac* And their princesses—your nursing mothers; Face to the earth—they bow down to you, \qac ǁ\qac* And they lick up the dust of your feet, \qac ǁ\qac* And you have known that I [am] \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* That those expecting Me are not ashamed.”
\v 24 Is prey taken from the mighty? And the captive of the righteous delivered?
\v 25 For thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*: “Even the captive of the mighty is taken, \qac ǁ\qac* And the prey of the terrible is delivered, \qac ǁ\qac* And I strive with your striver, and I save your sons.
\v 26 And I have caused your oppressors to eat their own flesh, \qac ǁ\qac* And they drink their own blood as new wine, \qac ǁ\qac* And all flesh has known that I, \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Your Savior, and your Redeemer, \qac ǁ\qac* [Am] the Mighty One of Jacob!”

\v 1 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*: “Where [is] this—the bill of your mother’s divorce, \qac ǁ\qac* Whom I sent away? Or to which of My creditors have I sold you? Behold, you have been sold for your iniquities, \qac ǁ\qac* And for your transgressions \qac ǁ\qac* Your mother has been sent away.
\v 2 Why have I come, and there is no one? I called, and there is none answering, \qac ǁ\qac* Has My hand been at all short of redemption? And is there not power in Me to deliver? Behold, by My rebuke I dry up a sea, \qac ǁ\qac* I make rivers a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* Their fish stink, for there is no water, \qac ǁ\qac* And die with thirst.
\v 3 I clothe the heavens [with] blackness, \qac ǁ\qac* And I make their covering sackcloth.”
\v 4 Lord \nd Yhwh\nd* has given to Me \qac ǁ\qac* The tongue of taught ones, \qac ǁ\qac* To know to aid the weary [by] a word, \qac ǁ\qac* He awakens [Me] morning by morning, \qac ǁ\qac* He awakens [My] ear to hear as taught ones.
\v 5 Lord \nd Yhwh\nd* opened My ear, \qac ǁ\qac* And I did not rebel—I did not move backward.
\v 6 I have given My back to those striking, \qac ǁ\qac* And My cheeks to those plucking out, \qac ǁ\qac* I did not hide My face from shame and spitting.
\v 7 And Lord \nd Yhwh\nd* gives help to Me, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore I have not been ashamed, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore I have set My face as a flint, \qac ǁ\qac* And I know that I am not ashamed.
\v 8 Near [is] He who is justifying Me, \qac ǁ\qac* Who contends with Me? We stand together, who [is] My opponent? Let him come near to Me.
\v 9 Behold, Lord \nd Yhwh\nd* gives help to Me, \qac ǁ\qac* Who [is] he that declares Me wicked? Behold, all of them wear out as a garment, \qac ǁ\qac* A moth eats them.
\v 10 “Who [is] among you, fearing \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Listening to the voice of His Servant, \qac ǁ\qac* That has walked in dark places, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is no brightness for him? Let him trust in the Name of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And lean on his God.
\v 11 Behold, all you kindling a fire, girding on sparks, \qac ǁ\qac* Walk in the light of your fire, \qac ǁ\qac* And in the sparks you have caused to burn, \qac ǁ\qac* This has been to you from My hand, \qac ǁ\qac* You lie down in grief!”

\v 3 For \nd Yhwh\nd* has comforted Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* He has comforted all her ruins, \qac ǁ\qac* And He sets her wilderness as Eden, \qac ǁ\qac* And her desert as a garden of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Joy, indeed, gladness is found in her, \qac ǁ\qac* Confession, and the voice of song.

\v 5 My righteousness [is] near, \qac ǁ\qac* My salvation has gone out, \qac ǁ\qac* And My arms judge peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* Islands wait on Me, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, on My arm they wait with hope.
\v 6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* And look attentively to the earth beneath, \qac ǁ\qac* For the heavens have vanished as smoke, \qac ǁ\qac* And the earth wears out as a garment, \qac ǁ\qac* And its inhabitants die as gnats, \qac ǁ\qac* And My salvation is for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* And My righteousness is not broken.
\v 7 Listen to Me, you who know righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* A people in whose heart [is] My law, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not fear the reproach of men, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not be frightened of their reviling,
\v 8 For a moth eats them as a garment, \qac ǁ\qac* And a worm eats them as wool, \qac ǁ\qac* And My righteousness is for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* And My salvation from generation to generation.”
\v 9 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Awake, as [in] days of old, generations of the ages, \qac ǁ\qac* Are You not it that is hewing down Rahab, \qac ǁ\qac* Piercing a dragon?
\v 10 Are You not it that is drying up a sea, \qac ǁ\qac* Waters of a great deep? That has made deep places of a sea \qac ǁ\qac* A way for the passing of the redeemed?
\v 11 And the ransomed of \nd Yhwh\nd* return, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have come to Zion with singing, \qac ǁ\qac* And continuous joy [is] on their head, \qac ǁ\qac* They attain gladness and joy, \qac ǁ\qac* Sorrow and sighing have fled away,
\v 12 “I [am] He who comforts you, \qac ǁ\qac* Who [are] you—and you are afraid of man? He dies! And of the son of man—he is made [like] grass!
\v 13 And you forget \nd Yhwh\nd* your Maker, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is stretching out the heavens, and founding earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And you continually fear all the day, \qac ǁ\qac* Because of the fury of the oppressor, \qac ǁ\qac* As he has prepared to destroy. And where [is] the fury of the oppressor?
\v 14 A wanderer has hurried to be loosed, \qac ǁ\qac* And he does not die in the pit, \qac ǁ\qac* And his bread is not lacking.
\v 15 And I [am] your God \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Quieting the sea when its billows roar, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts [is] His Name.
\v 16 And I put My words in your mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* And have covered you with the shadow of My hand, \qac ǁ\qac* To plant the heavens, and to found earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And to say to Zion, You [are] My people.”
\v 17 Stir yourself, stir yourself, rise, Jerusalem, \qac ǁ\qac* You who have drunk from the hand of \nd Yhwh\nd* \qac ǁ\qac* The cup of His fury, \qac ǁ\qac* The goblet, the cup of trembling, you have drunk, \qac ǁ\qac* You have wrung out.
\v 18 There is not a leader to her \qac ǁ\qac* Out of all the sons she has borne, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is none laying hold on her hand \qac ǁ\qac* Out of all the sons she has nourished.
\v 19 These two are meeting you, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is moved for you? Spoiling and destruction, famine and sword! By whom do I comfort you?
\v 20 Your sons have been wrapped up, they have lain down, \qac ǁ\qac* At the head of all out places, as an antelope [in] a dragnet, \qac ǁ\qac* They are full of the fury of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* The rebuke of Your God.
\v 21 Therefore, please hear this, \qac ǁ\qac* O afflicted and drunken one, and not with wine,
\v 22 Thus said your Lord \nd Yhwh\nd*, and your God, \qac ǁ\qac* He pleads [for] His people: “Behold, I have taken the cup of trembling out of your hand, \qac ǁ\qac* The goblet, the cup of My fury, \qac ǁ\qac* You do not add to drink it anymore.
\v 23 And I have put it into the hand of those afflicting you, \qac ǁ\qac* Who have said to your soul, \qac ǁ\qac* Bow down, and we pass over, \qac ǁ\qac* And you make your body as the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And as the street to those passing by!”
\c 52
\p
\v 1 Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* Put on the garments of your beauty, Jerusalem—the Holy City; For the uncircumcised and unclean no longer enter into you again.
\v 2 Shake yourself from dust, arise, sit, O Jerusalem, \qac ǁ\qac* Bands of your neck have loosed themselves, \qac ǁ\qac* O captive daughter of Zion.
\v 3 For thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*: “You have been sold for nothing, \qac ǁ\qac* And you are redeemed without money.”
\v 4 For thus said Lord \nd Yhwh\nd*: “My people went down at first \qac ǁ\qac* To Egypt to sojourn there, \qac ǁ\qac* And Asshur—he has oppressed it for nothing.
\v 5 And now, what [have] I here,” \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* “That My people are taken for nothing? Its rulers cause howling,” \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* “And My Name is continually despised all the day.
\v 6 Therefore My people know My Name, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore, in that day, \qac ǁ\qac* Surely I [am] He who is speaking, behold Me.”
\v 7 How lovely on the mountains, \qac ǁ\qac* Have been the feet of one proclaiming tidings, \qac ǁ\qac* Sounding peace, proclaiming good tidings, \qac ǁ\qac* Sounding salvation, \qac ǁ\qac* Saying to Zion, “Your God has reigned.”
\v 8 The voice of your watchmen! They have lifted up the voice, together they cry aloud, \qac ǁ\qac* Because they see eye to eye, \qac ǁ\qac* In \nd Yhwh\nd*’s turning back [to] Zion.
\v 9 Break forth, sing together, \qac ǁ\qac* O ruins of Jerusalem, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* has comforted His people, \qac ǁ\qac* He has redeemed Jerusalem.
\v 10 \nd Yhwh\nd* has made His holy arm bare \qac ǁ\qac* Before the eyes of all the nations, \qac ǁ\qac* And all the ends of the earth have seen \qac ǁ\qac* The salvation of our God.
\v 11 Turn aside, turn aside, go out from there, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not touch the unclean, \qac ǁ\qac* Go out from her midst, \qac ǁ\qac* Be pure, who are carrying the weapons of \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 12 For you do not go out in haste, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, you do not go on with flight, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] going before you, \qac ǁ\qac* And the God of Israel [is] gathering you!
\v 13 “Behold, My Servant acts wisely, \qac ǁ\qac* He is high, and has been lifted up, \qac ǁ\qac* And has been very high.”
\v 14 As many have been astonished at You \qac ǁ\qac* (His appearance so marred by man, \qac ǁ\qac* And His form by sons of men),
\v 15 So He sprinkles many nations. Kings shut their mouth concerning Him, \qac ǁ\qac* For that which was not recounted to them they have seen, \qac ǁ\qac* And that which they had not heard they have understood!
\c 53
\p
\v 1 Who has given credence to that which we heard? And the arm of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* On whom has it been revealed?
\v 2 Indeed, He comes up as a tender plant before Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And as a root out of dry land, \qac ǁ\qac* He has no form or splendor when we observe Him, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor appearance, that we desire Him.
\v 3 He is despised, and left of men, \qac ǁ\qac* A Man of pains, and acquainted with sickness, \qac ǁ\qac* And as one hiding the face from us, \qac ǁ\qac* He is despised, and we did not esteem Him.
\v 4 Surely He has borne our sicknesses, \qac ǁ\qac* And our pains—He has carried them, \qac ǁ\qac* And we have esteemed Him [as] plagued, struck of God, and afflicted.
\v 5 And He is pierced for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities, \qac ǁ\qac* The discipline of our peace [is] on Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And by His scourging we are healed.
\v 6 All of us, like sheep, have wandered, \qac ǁ\qac* Man has turned to his own way, \qac ǁ\qac* And \nd Yhwh\nd* has laid on Him the punishment of us all.
\v 7 It has been exacted, and He has answered, \qac ǁ\qac* And He does not open His mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, \qac ǁ\qac* And as a sheep before its shearers is silent, \qac ǁ\qac* So He does not open His mouth.
\v 8 By restraint and by judgment He has been taken, \qac ǁ\qac* And of His generation who meditates, \qac ǁ\qac* That He has been cut off from the land of the living? He is plagued by the transgression of My people,
\v 9 And He appoints His grave with the wicked, \qac ǁ\qac* And with the rich at His death, \qac ǁ\qac* Because He has done no violence, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor [is] deceit in His mouth.
\v 10 And \nd Yhwh\nd* has delighted to crush Him, \qac ǁ\qac* He has made Him sick; If His soul makes an offering for guilt, \qac ǁ\qac* He sees [His] seed—He prolongs [His] days, \qac ǁ\qac* And the pleasure of \nd Yhwh\nd* prospers in His hand.
\v 11 Of the labor of His soul He sees—He is satisfied, \qac ǁ\qac* Through His knowledge My Righteous Servant gives righteousness to many, \qac ǁ\qac* And He bears their iniquities.
\v 12 Therefore I give a portion to Him among the many, \qac ǁ\qac* And He apportions spoil with the mighty, \qac ǁ\qac* Because that He exposed His soul to death, \qac ǁ\qac* And He was numbered with transgressors, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has borne the sin of many, \qac ǁ\qac* And He intercedes for transgressors.
\c 54
\p
\v 1 “Sing, O barren, she [who] has not borne! Break forth with singing, and cry aloud, \qac ǁ\qac* She [who] has not brought forth! For more [are] the sons of the desolate, \qac ǁ\qac* Than the sons of the married one,” said \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 2 “Enlarge the place of your tent, \qac ǁ\qac* And they stretch out the curtains of your dwelling places, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not restrain—lengthen your cords, \qac ǁ\qac* And make your pins strong.
\v 3 For you break forth right and left, \qac ǁ\qac* And nations possess your seed,
\v 4 And they cause desolate cities to be inhabited. Do not fear, for you are not ashamed, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor blush, for you are not confounded, \qac ǁ\qac* For you forget the shame of your youth, \qac ǁ\qac* And the reproach of your widowhood \qac ǁ\qac* You do not remember anymore.
\v 5 For your Maker [is] your husband, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* of Hosts [is] His Name, \qac ǁ\qac* And your Redeemer [is] the Holy One of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* He is called God of all the earth.
\v 6 For as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* has called you, \qac ǁ\qac* Even a youthful wife when she is refused,” said your God.
\v 7 “In a small moment I have forsaken you, \qac ǁ\qac* And in great mercies I gather you,
\v 8 In overflowing wrath I hid My face [for] a moment from you, \qac ǁ\qac* And in perpetual kindness I have loved you, \qac ǁ\qac* Said your Redeemer—\nd Yhwh\nd*!
\v 9 For this [is as] the days of Noah to Me, \qac ǁ\qac* In that I have sworn that the waters of Noah \qac ǁ\qac* Do not pass over the earth again—So I have sworn, \qac ǁ\qac* Wrath is not on you, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor rebuke against you.
\v 10 For the mountains depart, and the hills remove, \qac ǁ\qac* And My kindness does not depart from you, \qac ǁ\qac* And the covenant of My peace does not remove,” \qac ǁ\qac* Says \nd Yhwh\nd*, your loving one.
\v 11 “O afflicted, storm-tossed, not comforted, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, I am laying your stones with cement, \qac ǁ\qac* And have founded you with sapphires,
\v 12 And have made your pinnacles of agate, \qac ǁ\qac* And your gates of carbuncle stones, \qac ǁ\qac* And all your border of stones of delight,
\v 13 And all your sons are taught of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And the peace of your sons [is] abundant.
\v 14 You establish yourself in righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* Be far from oppression, for you do not fear, \qac ǁ\qac* And from ruin, for it does not come near to you.
\v 15 Behold, he diligently assembles without My desire, \qac ǁ\qac* Whoever has assembled near you falls by you!
\v 16 Behold, I have created an artisan, \qac ǁ\qac* Blowing on a fire of coals, \qac ǁ\qac* And bringing out an instrument for his work, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have created a destroyer to destroy.
\v 17 No weapon formed against you prospers, \qac ǁ\qac* And every tongue rising against you, \qac ǁ\qac* You condemn in judgment. This [is] the inheritance of the servants of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And their righteousness from Me,” a declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*!
\c 55
\p
\v 1 “Behold, every thirsty one, \qac ǁ\qac* Come to the waters, \qac ǁ\qac* And he who has no money, \qac ǁ\qac* Come, buy and eat, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, come, buy wine and milk \qac ǁ\qac* Without money and without price.
\v 2 Why do you weigh money for that which is not bread? And your labor for that which is not for satiety? Listen diligently to Me, and eat good, \qac ǁ\qac* And your soul delights itself in fatness.
\v 3 Incline your ear, and come to Me, \qac ǁ\qac* Hear, and your soul lives, \qac ǁ\qac* And I make a perpetual covenant for you, \qac ǁ\qac* The kind blessings of David that are steadfast.
\v 4 Behold, I have given him [as] a witness to peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* A leader and commander to peoples.
\v 5 Behold, a nation you do not know, you call, \qac ǁ\qac* And a nation who does not know you runs to you, \qac ǁ\qac* For the sake of your God \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And for the Holy One of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* Because He has beautified you.”
\v 6 Seek \nd Yhwh\nd* while He may be found, \qac ǁ\qac* Call Him while He is near,
\v 7 Let the wicked forsake his way, \qac ǁ\qac* And the man of iniquity his thoughts, \qac ǁ\qac* And he returns to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And He pities him, \qac ǁ\qac* And to our God, \qac ǁ\qac* For He multiplies to pardon.
\v 8 “For My thoughts [are] not your thoughts, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor your ways My ways,” \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*,
\v 9 “For [as] high [as] the heavens have been above the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* So high have been My ways above your ways, \qac ǁ\qac* And My thoughts above your thoughts.
\v 10 For as the shower comes down, \qac ǁ\qac* And the snow from the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* And does not return there, \qac ǁ\qac* But has watered the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And has caused it to yield, and to spring up, \qac ǁ\qac* And has given seed to the sower, and bread to the eater,
\v 11 So is My word that goes out of My mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* It does not return to Me empty, \qac ǁ\qac* But has done that which I desired, \qac ǁ\qac* And prosperously effected that [for] which I sent it.
\v 12 For you go forth with joy, \qac ǁ\qac* And you are brought in with peace, \qac ǁ\qac* The mountains and the hills \qac ǁ\qac* Break forth before you [with] singing, \qac ǁ\qac* And all trees of the field clap the hand.
\v 13 Instead of the thorn comes up fir, \qac ǁ\qac* Instead of the brier comes up myrtle, \qac ǁ\qac* And it has been to \nd Yhwh\nd* for a name, \qac ǁ\qac* For a perpetual sign—it is not cut off!”
\c 56
\p
\v 1 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*: “Keep judgment, and do righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* For My salvation [is] near to come, \qac ǁ\qac* And My righteousness to be revealed.”
\v 2 O the blessedness of a man who does this, \qac ǁ\qac* And of a son of man who keeps hold on it, \qac ǁ\qac* Keeping the Sabbath from defiling it, \qac ǁ\qac* And keeping his hand from doing any evil.
\v 3 Do not let a son of the stranger speak, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is joined to \nd Yhwh\nd*, saying, “\nd Yhwh\nd* certainly separates me from His people.” Nor let the eunuch say, “Behold, I am a dried up tree,”
\v 4 For thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*: “To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, \qac ǁ\qac* And have fixed on that which I desired, \qac ǁ\qac* And are keeping hold on My covenant:
\v 5 I have given to them in My house, \qac ǁ\qac* And within My walls a station and a name, \qac ǁ\qac* Better than sons and than daughters, \qac ǁ\qac* I give a continuous name to him \qac ǁ\qac* That is not cut off.
\v 6 And sons of the stranger, who are joined to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* To serve Him, and to love the Name of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* To be for servants to Him, \qac ǁ\qac* All keeping from defiling the Sabbath, \qac ǁ\qac* And those keeping hold on My covenant,
\v 7 I have brought them to My holy mountain, \qac ǁ\qac* And caused them to rejoice in My house of prayer, \qac ǁ\qac* Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices \qac ǁ\qac* [Are] for a pleasing thing on My altar, \qac ǁ\qac* For My house is called a house of prayer for all the peoples.”
\v 8 A declaration of Lord \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Who is gathering the outcasts of Israel: “Again I gather to him—to his gathered ones.”
\v 9 Every beast of the field, \qac ǁ\qac* Come to devour, every beast in the forest.
\v 10 His watchmen [are] blind—all of them, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not known, \qac ǁ\qac* All of them [are] mute dogs, they are not able to bark, \qac ǁ\qac* Dozing, lying down, loving to slumber.
\v 11 And the dogs [are] strong of desire, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not known sufficiency, \qac ǁ\qac* And they [are] shepherds! They have not known understanding, \qac ǁ\qac* All of them turned to their own way, \qac ǁ\qac* Each to his dishonest gain from his quarter:
\v 12 “Come, I take wine, \qac ǁ\qac* And we drink, gulp strong drink, \qac ǁ\qac* And tomorrow has been as this day, \qac ǁ\qac* Great—exceedingly abundant!”
\c 57
\p
\v 1 The righteous has perished, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is none laying [it] to heart, \qac ǁ\qac* And men of kindness are gathered, \qac ǁ\qac* Without any considering that from the face of evil \qac ǁ\qac* The righteous one is gathered.
\v 2 He enters into peace, they rest on their beds, \qac ǁ\qac* [Each] is going straightforward.
\v 3 “And you, come near here, \qac ǁ\qac* O sons of a sorceress, seed of an adulterer, \qac ǁ\qac* Even you commit whoredom.
\v 4 Against whom do you sport yourselves? Against whom do you enlarge the mouth \qac ǁ\qac* [And] prolong the tongue? Are you not children of transgression? A false seed?
\v 5 Who are inflamed among oaks, under every green tree, \qac ǁ\qac* Slaughtering the children in valleys, \qac ǁ\qac* Under clefts of the rocks.
\v 6 Your portion [is] among the smooth things of a brook, \qac ǁ\qac* They [are] your lot, \qac ǁ\qac* You have also poured out an oblation to them, \qac ǁ\qac* You have caused a present to ascend, \qac ǁ\qac* Am I comforted in these things?
\v 7 On a mountain, high and exalted, \qac ǁ\qac* You have set your bed, \qac ǁ\qac* You have also gone up there to make a sacrifice.
\v 8 And behind the door, and the post, \qac ǁ\qac* You have set up your memorial, \qac ǁ\qac* For you have removed from Me, and go up, \qac ǁ\qac* You have enlarged your bed, \qac ǁ\qac* And cut [a covenant] with them, \qac ǁ\qac* You have loved their bed, the station you saw,
\v 9 And go joyfully to the king in ointment, \qac ǁ\qac* And multiply your perfumes, \qac ǁ\qac* And send your ambassadors far off, \qac ǁ\qac* And humble yourself to Sheol.
\v 10 You have labored in the greatness of your way, \qac ǁ\qac* You have not said, It is desperate. You have found the life of your hand, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore you have not been sick.
\v 11 And of whom have you been afraid, and fear, \qac ǁ\qac* That you lie, and have not remembered Me? You have not laid [it] to your heart, \qac ǁ\qac* Am I not silent, even from of old? And you do not fear Me?
\v 12 I declare your righteousness, and your works, \qac ǁ\qac* And they do not profit you.
\v 13 When you cry, let your gatherings deliver you, \qac ǁ\qac* And wind carries all of them away, \qac ǁ\qac* Vanity takes away, \qac ǁ\qac* And whoever is trusting in Me inherits the land, \qac ǁ\qac* And possesses My holy mountain.”
\v 14 And He has said, “Raise up, raise up, prepare a way, \qac ǁ\qac* Lift a stumbling-block out of the way of My people.”
\v 15 For thus said the high and exalted One, \qac ǁ\qac* Inhabiting eternity, and His Name [is] holy: “I dwell in the high and holy place, \qac ǁ\qac* And with the bruised and humble of spirit, \qac ǁ\qac* To revive the spirit of the humble, \qac ǁ\qac* And to revive the heart of bruised ones,
\v 16 For I do not strive for all time, nor am I angry forever, \qac ǁ\qac* For the spirit is feeble before Me, \qac ǁ\qac* And the souls I have made.
\v 17 For the iniquity of his dishonest gain, \qac ǁ\qac* I have been angry, and I strike him, \qac ǁ\qac* Hiding—and am angry, \qac ǁ\qac* And he goes on turning back in the way of his heart.
\v 18 I have seen his ways, and I heal him, indeed, I lead him, \qac ǁ\qac* And repay comforts to him and to his mourning ones.
\v 19 Producing the fruit of the lips, \qac ǁ\qac* Peace, peace, to the far off, and to the near, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have healed him,” said \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 20 And the wicked [are] as the driven out sea, \qac ǁ\qac* For it is not able to rest, \qac ǁ\qac* And its waters cast out filth and mire.
\v 21 “There is no peace,” said my God, “for the wicked!”
\c 58
\p
\v 1 “Call with the throat, do not restrain, lift up your voice as a horn, \qac ǁ\qac* And declare to My people their transgression, \qac ǁ\qac* And to the house of Jacob their sins;
\v 2 They seek Me day by day, \qac ǁ\qac* And they desire the knowledge of My ways, \qac ǁ\qac* As a nation that has done righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And has not forsaken the judgment of its God, \qac ǁ\qac* They ask of Me judgments of righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* They desire the drawing near of God:
\v 3 Why have we fasted, and You have not seen? We have afflicted our soul, and You do not know. Behold, you find pleasure in the day of your fast, \qac ǁ\qac* And exact all your laborers.
\v 4 Behold, you fast for strife and debate, \qac ǁ\qac* And to strike with the fist of wickedness, \qac ǁ\qac* You do not fast as [this] day, \qac ǁ\qac* To sound your voice in the high place.
\v 5 Is this like the fast that I choose? The day of a man’s afflicting his soul? To bow his head as a reed, \qac ǁ\qac* And spread out sackcloth and ashes? Do you call this a fast, \qac ǁ\qac* And a desirable day—to \nd Yhwh\nd*?
\v 6 Is this not the fast that I chose—To loose the bands of wickedness, \qac ǁ\qac* To shake off the burdens of the yoke, \qac ǁ\qac* And to send out the oppressed free, \qac ǁ\qac* And draw off every yoke?
\v 7 Is it not to deal your bread to the hungry, \qac ǁ\qac* And bring home the wandering poor, \qac ǁ\qac* That you see the naked and cover him, \qac ǁ\qac* And do not hide yourself from your own flesh?
\v 8 Then your light breaks forth as the dawn, \qac ǁ\qac* And your health springs up in haste, \qac ǁ\qac* Your righteousness has gone before you, \qac ǁ\qac* The glory of \nd Yhwh\nd* gathers you.
\v 9 Then you call, and \nd Yhwh\nd* answers, \qac ǁ\qac* You cry, and He says, Behold Me. If you turn aside the yoke from your midst, \qac ǁ\qac* The sending forth of the finger, \qac ǁ\qac* And the speaking of vanity,
\v 10 And bring out your soul to the hungry, \qac ǁ\qac* And satisfy the afflicted soul, \qac ǁ\qac* Then your light has risen in the darkness, \qac ǁ\qac* And your thick darkness [is] as noon.
\v 11 And \nd Yhwh\nd* continually leads you, \qac ǁ\qac* And has satisfied your soul in drought, \qac ǁ\qac* And He arms your bones, \qac ǁ\qac* And you have been as a watered garden, \qac ǁ\qac* And as an outlet of waters, whose waters do not lie.
\v 12 And they have built the ancient ruins from you, \qac ǁ\qac* You raise up the foundations of many generations, \qac ǁ\qac* And one calls you, Repairer of the breach, \qac ǁ\qac* Restorer of paths to rest in.
\v 13 If you turn your foot from the Sabbath, \qac ǁ\qac* [From] doing your own pleasure on My holy day, \qac ǁ\qac* And have cried to the Sabbath, A delight, \qac ǁ\qac* To the holy of \nd Yhwh\nd*, Honored, \qac ǁ\qac* And have honored it, without doing your own ways, \qac ǁ\qac* Without finding your own pleasure, \qac ǁ\qac* And speaking a word.
\v 14 Then you delight yourself on \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have caused you to ride on high places of earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And have caused you to eat the inheritance of your father Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* For the mouth of \nd Yhwh\nd* has spoken!”
\c 59
\p
\v 1 Behold, the hand of \nd Yhwh\nd* \qac ǁ\qac* Has not been shortened from saving, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor His ear heavy from hearing.
\v 2 But your iniquities have been separating \qac ǁ\qac* Between you and your God, \qac ǁ\qac* And your sins have hidden \qac ǁ\qac* The Presence from you—from hearing.
\v 3 For your hands have been defiled with blood, \qac ǁ\qac* And your fingers with iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* Your lips have spoken falsehood, \qac ǁ\qac* Your tongue mutters perverseness.
\v 4 There is none calling in righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is none pleading in faithfulness, \qac ǁ\qac* Trusting on emptiness, and speaking falsehood, \qac ǁ\qac* Conceiving perverseness, and bearing iniquity.
\v 5 They have hatched eggs of a viper, \qac ǁ\qac* And weave webs of a spider, \qac ǁ\qac* Whoever is eating their eggs dies, and the crushed hatches a viper.
\v 6 Their webs do not become a garment, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor do they cover themselves with their works, \qac ǁ\qac* Their works [are] works of iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* And a deed of violence [is] in their hands.
\v 7 Their feet run to evil, \qac ǁ\qac* And they hurry to shed innocent blood, \qac ǁ\qac* Their thoughts [are] thoughts of iniquity, \qac ǁ\qac* Spoiling and destruction [are] in their highways.
\v 8 They have not known a way of peace, \qac ǁ\qac* And there is no judgment in their paths, \qac ǁ\qac* They have made their paths perverse for themselves, \qac ǁ\qac* None treading in it has known peace.
\v 9 Therefore judgment has been far from us, \qac ǁ\qac* And righteousness does not reach us, \qac ǁ\qac* We wait for light, and behold, darkness, \qac ǁ\qac* For brightness—in thick darkness we go,
\v 10 We feel [for] the wall like the blind, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, we feel as without eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* We have stumbled at noon as at twilight, \qac ǁ\qac* In desolate places as the dead.
\v 11 We make a noise as bears—all of us, \qac ǁ\qac* And we coo severely as doves; We wait for judgment, and there is none, \qac ǁ\qac* For salvation—it has been far from us.
\v 12 For our transgressions have been multiplied before You, \qac ǁ\qac* And our sins have testified against us, \qac ǁ\qac* For our transgressions [are] with us, \qac ǁ\qac* And our iniquities—we have known them.
\v 13 Transgressing, and lying against \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And removing from after our God, \qac ǁ\qac* Speaking oppression and apostasy, \qac ǁ\qac* Conceiving and uttering from the heart \qac ǁ\qac* Words of falsehood.
\v 14 And judgment is removed backward, \qac ǁ\qac* And righteousness stands far off, \qac ǁ\qac* For truth has been feeble in the street, \qac ǁ\qac* And straightforwardness is not able to enter,
\v 15 And the truth is lacking, \qac ǁ\qac* And whoever is turning aside from evil, \qac ǁ\qac* Is making himself a spoil. And \nd Yhwh\nd* sees, and it is evil in His eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* That there is no judgment.
\v 16 And He sees that there is no man, \qac ǁ\qac* And is astonished that there is no intercessor, \qac ǁ\qac* And His own arm gives salvation to Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And His righteousness—it sustained Him.
\v 17 And He puts on righteousness as a breastplate, \qac ǁ\qac* And a helmet of salvation on His head, \qac ǁ\qac* And He puts on garments of vengeance [for] clothing, \qac ǁ\qac* And is covered, as [with] an upper-robe, [with] zeal.
\v 18 According to deeds—so He repays. Fury to His adversaries, [their] deed to His enemies, \qac ǁ\qac* To the islands He repays [their] deed.
\v 19 And from the west they fear the Name of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And from the rising of the sun—His glory, \qac ǁ\qac* When an adversary comes in as a flood, \qac ǁ\qac* The Spirit of \nd Yhwh\nd* has raised an ensign against him.
\v 20 “And the Redeemer has come to Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* Even to captives of transgression in Jacob,” \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 21 “And I—this [is] My covenant with them,” said \nd Yhwh\nd*, “My Spirit that [is] on you, \qac ǁ\qac* And My words that I have put in your mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* Do not depart from your mouth, \qac ǁ\qac* And from the mouth of your seed, \qac ǁ\qac* And from the mouth of your seed’s seed,” said \nd Yhwh\nd*, “From now on, even for all time!”
\c 60
\p
\v 1 Arise, shine, for your light has come, \qac ǁ\qac* And the glory of \nd Yhwh\nd* has risen on you.
\v 2 For behold, the darkness covers the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And thick darkness the peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* And \nd Yhwh\nd* rises on you, \qac ǁ\qac* And His glory is seen on you.
\v 3 And nations have come to your light, \qac ǁ\qac* And kings to the brightness of your rising.
\v 4 “Lift up your eyes around and see, \qac ǁ\qac* All of them have been gathered, they have come to you, \qac ǁ\qac* Your sons come from afar, \qac ǁ\qac* And your daughters are supported on the side.
\v 5 Then you see, and have become bright, \qac ǁ\qac* And your heart has been afraid and enlarged, \qac ǁ\qac* For the multitude of the sea turn to you, \qac ǁ\qac* The forces of nations come to you.
\v 6 A multitude of camels covers you, \qac ǁ\qac* Dromedaries of Midian and Ephah, \qac ǁ\qac* All of them from Sheba come, \qac ǁ\qac* They carry gold and frankincense, \qac ǁ\qac* And they proclaim the praises of \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 7 All the flock of Kedar are gathered to you, \qac ǁ\qac* The rams of Nebaioth serve you, \qac ǁ\qac* They ascend My altar for acceptance, \qac ǁ\qac* And I beautify the house of My beauty.
\v 8 Who [are] these—they fly as a thick cloud, \qac ǁ\qac* And as doves to their windows?
\v 9 Surely islands wait for Me, \qac ǁ\qac* And ships of Tarshish first, \qac ǁ\qac* To bring your sons from afar, \qac ǁ\qac* Their silver and their gold with them, \qac ǁ\qac* To the Name of your God \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And to the Holy One of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* Because He has beautified you.
\v 10 And sons of a stranger have built your walls, \qac ǁ\qac* And their kings serve you, \qac ǁ\qac* For in My wrath I have struck you, \qac ǁ\qac* And in My good pleasure I have pitied you.
\v 11 And your gates have continually opened, \qac ǁ\qac* They are not shut by day and by night, \qac ǁ\qac* To bring the force of nations to you, \qac ǁ\qac* Even their kings are led.
\v 12 For the nation and the kingdom that does not serve you perishes, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, the nations are utterly desolated.
\v 13 The glory of Lebanon comes to you, \qac ǁ\qac* Fir, pine, and box together, \qac ǁ\qac* To beautify the place of My sanctuary, \qac ǁ\qac* And I make the place of My feet honorable.
\v 14 And the sons of those afflicting you \qac ǁ\qac* Have come to you, bowing down, \qac ǁ\qac* And all despising you \qac ǁ\qac* Have bowed themselves to the soles of your feet, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have cried to you: The City of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Zion of the Holy One of Israel!
\v 15 Instead of your being forsaken and hated, \qac ǁ\qac* And none passing through, \qac ǁ\qac* I have made you for a continuous excellence, \qac ǁ\qac* A joy of generation and generation.
\v 16 And you have sucked the milk of nations, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, you suckle the breast of kings, \qac ǁ\qac* And you have known that I, \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Your Savior, and Your Redeemer, \qac ǁ\qac* [Am] the Mighty One of Jacob.
\v 17 Instead of the bronze I bring in gold, \qac ǁ\qac* And instead of the iron I bring in silver, \qac ǁ\qac* And instead of the wood bronze, \qac ǁ\qac* And instead of the stone iron, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have made your inspection peace, \qac ǁ\qac* And your exactors righteousness.
\v 18 Violence is not heard in your land anymore, \qac ǁ\qac* Spoiling and destruction in your borders, \qac ǁ\qac* And you have called your walls Salvation, \qac ǁ\qac* And your gates Praise.
\v 19 The sun is no longer your light by day, \qac ǁ\qac* And for brightness the moon does not give light to you, \qac ǁ\qac* And \nd Yhwh\nd* has become to you \qac ǁ\qac* A continuous light, and your God your beauty.
\v 20 Your sun goes in no more, \qac ǁ\qac* And your moon is not removed, \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* becomes a continuous light to you. And the days of your mourning have been completed.
\v 21 And all your people [are] righteous, \qac ǁ\qac* They possess the earth for all time, \qac ǁ\qac* A branch of My planting, \qac ǁ\qac* A work of My hands, to be beautified.
\v 22 The little one becomes a chief, \qac ǁ\qac* And the small one a mighty nation, \qac ǁ\qac* I, \nd Yhwh\nd*, hurry it in its own time!”
\c 61
\p
\v 1 “[The] Spirit of Lord \nd Yhwh\nd* [is] on Me, \qac ǁ\qac* Because \nd Yhwh\nd* anointed Me \qac ǁ\qac* To proclaim tidings to the humble, \qac ǁ\qac* He sent Me to bind the broken of heart, \qac ǁ\qac* To proclaim liberty to the captives, \qac ǁ\qac* And an opening of bands to [those] bound.
\v 2 To proclaim the year of the favor of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And the day of vengeance of our God, \qac ǁ\qac* To comfort all mourners.
\v 3 To appoint to mourners in Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* To give to them beauty instead of ashes, \qac ǁ\qac* The oil of joy instead of mourning, \qac ǁ\qac* A covering of praise for a faded spirit, \qac ǁ\qac* And He is calling to them, Trees of righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* The planting of \nd Yhwh\nd*—to be beautified.”
\v 4 And they have built the ancient ruins, \qac ǁ\qac* They raise up the desolations of the ancients, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have renewed ruined cities, \qac ǁ\qac* The desolations of generation and generation.
\v 5 And strangers have stood and fed your flock, \qac ǁ\qac* And the sons of a foreigner \qac ǁ\qac* [Are] your farmers and your vinedressers.
\v 6 And you are called priests of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* It is said of you [that you are] ministers of our God, \qac ǁ\qac* You consume the strength of nations, \qac ǁ\qac* And you boast yourselves in their glory.
\v 7 Instead of your shame—double [honor], \qac ǁ\qac* And [instead of] confusion, \qac ǁ\qac* They rejoice in their portion, \qac ǁ\qac* Therefore they take possession in their land a second time, \qac ǁ\qac* Continuous joy [is] for them.
\v 8 “For I [am] \nd Yhwh\nd*, loving judgment, \qac ǁ\qac* Hating plunder for a burnt-offering, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have given their wage in truth, \qac ǁ\qac* And I make a perpetual covenant for them.
\v 9 And their seed has been known among the nations, \qac ǁ\qac* And their offspring in the midst of the peoples, \qac ǁ\qac* All their beholders acknowledge them, \qac ǁ\qac* For they [are] a seed \nd Yhwh\nd* has blessed.”
\v 10 I greatly rejoice in \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* My soul rejoices in my God, \qac ǁ\qac* For He clothed me with garments of salvation, \qac ǁ\qac* [And] covered me with a robe of righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* As a bridegroom prepares ornaments, \qac ǁ\qac* And as a bride puts on her jewels.
\v 11 For as the earth brings forth her shoots, \qac ǁ\qac* And as a garden causes its sown things to shoot up, \qac ǁ\qac* So Lord \nd Yhwh\nd* causes righteousness and praise \qac ǁ\qac* To shoot up before all the nations!
\c 62
\p
\v 1 For Zion’s sake I am not silent, \qac ǁ\qac* And for Jerusalem’s sake I do not rest, \qac ǁ\qac* Until her righteousness goes out as brightness, \qac ǁ\qac* And her salvation burns as a torch.
\v 2 And nations have seen your righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* And all kings your glory, \qac ǁ\qac* And He is giving a new name to you, \qac ǁ\qac* That the mouth of \nd Yhwh\nd* defines.
\v 3 And you have been a crown of beauty in the hand of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And a turban of royalty in the hand of your God,
\v 4 It is not said of you anymore, “Forsaken!” And of your land it is not said anymore, “Desolate,” \qac ǁ\qac* For to you is cried, “My delight [is] in her,” \qac ǁ\qac* And to your land, “Married,” \qac ǁ\qac* For \nd Yhwh\nd* has delighted in you, \qac ǁ\qac* And your land is married.
\v 5 For a young man marries a virgin, \qac ǁ\qac* Your builders marry you, \qac ǁ\qac* With the joy of a bridegroom over a bride, \qac ǁ\qac* Your God rejoices over you.
\v 6 “On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen, \qac ǁ\qac* All the day and all the night, \qac ǁ\qac* Continually, they are not silent.” O you remembering \nd Yhwh\nd*, do not keep silence for yourselves,
\v 7 And do not give silence to Him, \qac ǁ\qac* Until He establishes, and until He makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
\v 8 \nd Yhwh\nd* has sworn by His right hand, \qac ǁ\qac* Even by the arm of His strength: “I do not give your grain anymore [as] food for your enemies, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor do sons of a stranger drink your new wine, \qac ǁ\qac* For which you have labored.
\v 9 For those gathering it eat it, and have praised \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And those collecting it drink it in My holy courts.”
\v 10 Pass on, pass on through the gates, \qac ǁ\qac* Prepare the way of the people, \qac ǁ\qac* Raise up, raise up the highway, clear it from stones, \qac ǁ\qac* Lift up an ensign over the peoples.
\v 11 Behold, \nd Yhwh\nd* has proclaimed to the end of the earth: “Say to the daughter of Zion, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, your salvation has come, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, His hire [is] with Him, \qac ǁ\qac* And His wage before Him.”
\v 12 And they have cried to them, “The People of the Holy One! The Redeemed of \nd Yhwh\nd*!” Indeed, to you is called, “The sought out one, a city not forsaken!”
\c 63
\p
\v 1 Who [is] this coming from Edom? With dyed garments from Bozrah? This that is honorable in His clothing, \qac ǁ\qac* Traveling in the abundance of His power? “I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save.”
\v 2 Why [is] Your clothing red? And Your garments as treading in a winepress?
\v 3 “I have trodden a wine vat by Myself, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the peoples there is no one with Me, \qac ǁ\qac* And I tread them in My anger, \qac ǁ\qac* And I trample them in My fury, \qac ǁ\qac* Their strength is sprinkled on My garments, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have defiled all My clothing.
\v 4 For the day of vengeance [is] in My heart, \qac ǁ\qac* And the year of My redeemed has come.
\v 5 And I look attentively, and there is none helping, \qac ǁ\qac* And I am astonished that there is none supporting, \qac ǁ\qac* And My own arm gives salvation to Me. And My wrath—it has supported Me.
\v 6 And I tread down peoples in My anger, \qac ǁ\qac* And I make them drunk in My fury, \qac ǁ\qac* And I bring down their strength to earth.”
\v 7 I make mention of the kind acts of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* The praises of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* According to all that \nd Yhwh\nd* has done for us, \qac ǁ\qac* And the abundance of the goodness to the house of Israel, \qac ǁ\qac* That He has done for them, \qac ǁ\qac* According to His mercies, \qac ǁ\qac* And according to the abundance of His kind acts.
\v 8 And He says, “Surely they [are] My people, \qac ǁ\qac* Sons—they do not lie,” and He is to them for a Savior.
\v 9 In all their distress [He is] no adversary, \qac ǁ\qac* And the Messenger of His Presence saved them, \qac ǁ\qac* In His love and in His pity He redeemed them, \qac ǁ\qac* And He lifts them up, \qac ǁ\qac* And carries them all the days of old.
\v 10 And they have been rebellious and have grieved His Holy Spirit, \qac ǁ\qac* And He turns to them for an enemy, \qac ǁ\qac* He Himself has fought against them.
\v 11 And He remembers the days of old, \qac ǁ\qac* Moses—his people. Where [is] He who is bringing them up from the sea, \qac ǁ\qac* The shepherd of His flock? Where [is] He who is putting in its midst His Holy Spirit?
\v 12 Leading by the right hand of Moses, the arm of His glory, \qac ǁ\qac* Cleaving waters from before them, \qac ǁ\qac* To make to Himself a continuous Name.
\v 13 Leading them through the depths, \qac ǁ\qac* They do not stumble as a horse in a plain.
\v 14 As a beast goes down into a valley, \qac ǁ\qac* The Spirit of \nd Yhwh\nd* causes him to rest, \qac ǁ\qac* So You have led Your people, \qac ǁ\qac* To make to Yourself a glorious Name.
\v 15 Look attentively from the heavens, \qac ǁ\qac* And see from Your holy and beautiful habitation, \qac ǁ\qac* Where [is] Your zeal and Your might? The multitude of Your bowels and Your mercies—Are they restrained?
\v 16 For You [are] our Father, \qac ǁ\qac* For Abraham has not known us, \qac ǁ\qac* And Israel does not acknowledge us, \qac ǁ\qac* You, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, [are] our Father, \qac ǁ\qac* Our Redeemer from the Age, [is] Your Name.
\v 17 Why cause us to wander, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, from Your ways? You harden our heart from Your fear, \qac ǁ\qac* Turn back for Your servants’ sake, \qac ǁ\qac* The tribes of Your inheritance.
\v 18 For a little while Your holy people possessed, \qac ǁ\qac* Our adversaries have trodden down Your sanctuary.
\v 19 We have been from of old, \qac ǁ\qac* You have not ruled over them, \qac ǁ\qac* Your Name is not called on them!
\c 64
\p
\v 1 Did You not tear the heavens? You came down, \qac ǁ\qac* Mountains flowed from Your presence,
\v 2 (As fire kindles stubble—Fire causes water to boil), \qac ǁ\qac* To make Your Name known to Your adversaries, \qac ǁ\qac* Nations tremble from Your presence.
\v 3 In Your doing fearful things [that] we do not expect, \qac ǁ\qac* You came down, \qac ǁ\qac* Mountains flowed from Your presence.
\v 4 Even from antiquity [men] have not heard, \qac ǁ\qac* They have not given ear, \qac ǁ\qac* Eye has not seen a God except You, \qac ǁ\qac* He works for those waiting for Him.
\v 5 You have met with the rejoicer \qac ǁ\qac* And the doer of righteousness, \qac ǁ\qac* In Your ways they remember You, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, You have been angry when we sin, \qac ǁ\qac* By them [is] continuance, and we are saved.
\v 6 And we are as unclean—all of us, \qac ǁ\qac* And all our righteous acts [are] as garments of menstruation; And we fade as a leaf—all of us. And our iniquities take us away as wind.
\v 7 And there is none calling on Your Name, \qac ǁ\qac* Stirring himself up to lay hold on You, \qac ǁ\qac* For You have hid Your face from us, \qac ǁ\qac* And You melt us away by our iniquities.
\v 8 And now, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, You [are] our Father, \qac ǁ\qac* We [are] the clay, and You [are] our Framer, \qac ǁ\qac* And the work of Your hand—all of us.
\v 9 Do not be angry, O \nd Yhwh\nd*, very severely, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor remember iniquity forever, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, look attentively, we implore You, \qac ǁ\qac* We [are] all Your people.
\v 10 Your holy cities have been a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* Zion has been a wilderness, \qac ǁ\qac* Jerusalem a desolation.
\v 11 Our holy and our beautiful house, \qac ǁ\qac* Where our fathers praised You, \qac ǁ\qac* Has become burned with fire, \qac ǁ\qac* And all our desirable things have become a ruin.
\v 12 Do You refrain Yourself for these, \nd Yhwh\nd*? You are silent, and afflict us very severely!
\c 65

\v 1 “I have been inquired of by those who did not ask, \qac ǁ\qac* I have been found by those who did not seek Me, \qac ǁ\qac* I have said, Behold Me, behold Me, \qac ǁ\qac* To a nation not calling on My Name.
\v 2 I have spread out My hands all the day \qac ǁ\qac* To an apostate people, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are going in the way [that is] not good, \qac ǁ\qac* After their own thoughts.
\v 3 The people who are continually provoking Me to anger, \qac ǁ\qac* To My face, \qac ǁ\qac* Sacrificing in gardens, and making incense on the bricks:
\v 4 Who are dwelling among tombs, \qac ǁ\qac* And lodge in reserved places, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are eating flesh of the sow, \qac ǁ\qac* And a piece of abominations—their vessels.
\v 5 Who are saying, Keep to yourself, do not come near to me, \qac ǁ\qac* For I have declared you unholy. These [are] smoke in My anger, \qac ǁ\qac* A fire burning all the day.
\v 6 Behold, it is written before Me: I am not silent, but have repaid; And I have repaid into their bosom,
\v 7 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,” said \nd Yhwh\nd*, “Who have made incense on the mountains, \qac ǁ\qac* And have reproached Me on the heights, \qac ǁ\qac* And I have measured their former work into their bosom.”
\v 8 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*: “As the new wine is found in the cluster, \qac ǁ\qac* And one has said, Do not destroy it for a blessing [is] in it, \qac ǁ\qac* So I do for My servants’ sake, \qac ǁ\qac* Not to destroy the whole.
\v 9 And I have brought out a Seed from Jacob, \qac ǁ\qac* And from Judah a Possessor of My mountain, \qac ǁ\qac* And My chosen ones possess it, \qac ǁ\qac* And My servants dwell there.
\v 10 And Sharon has been for the habitation of a flock, \qac ǁ\qac* And the Valley of Achor for the lying down of a herd, \qac ǁ\qac* For My people who have sought Me.
\v 11 And you [are] those forsaking \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are forgetting My holy mountain, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are setting a table in array for Gad, \qac ǁ\qac* And who are filling a mixture for Meni.
\v 12 And I have numbered you for the sword, \qac ǁ\qac* And all of you bow down for slaughter, \qac ǁ\qac* Because I called, and you have not answered, \qac ǁ\qac* I have spoken, and you have not listened, \qac ǁ\qac* And you do evil in My eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* And on that which I did not desire—fixed.”
\v 13 Therefore, thus said Lord \nd Yhwh\nd*: “Behold, My servants eat, and you hunger, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, My servants drink, and you thirst, \qac ǁ\qac* Behold, My servants rejoice, and you are ashamed,
\v 14 Behold, My servants sing from joy of heart, \qac ǁ\qac* And you cry from pain of heart, \qac ǁ\qac* And you howl from breaking of spirit.
\v 15 And you have left your name \qac ǁ\qac* For an oath for My chosen ones, \qac ǁ\qac* And Lord \nd Yhwh\nd* has put you to death, \qac ǁ\qac* And He gives another name to His servants;
\v 16 So that he who is blessing himself in the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* Blesses himself in the God of faithfulness, \qac ǁ\qac* And he who is swearing in the earth, \qac ǁ\qac* Swears by the God of faithfulness, \qac ǁ\qac* Because the former distresses have been forgotten, \qac ǁ\qac* And because they have been hid from My eyes.
\v 17 For behold, I am creating new heavens and a new earth, \qac ǁ\qac* And the former things are not remembered, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor do they ascend on the heart.
\v 18 But rejoice, and rejoice forever, that I [am] Creator, \qac ǁ\qac* For behold, I am creating Jerusalem [to be] a rejoicing, \qac ǁ\qac* And her people a joy.
\v 19 And I have rejoiced in Jerusalem, \qac ǁ\qac* And have rejoiced in My people, \qac ǁ\qac* And the voice of weeping is not heard in her anymore, and the voice of crying.
\v 20 There is not a suckling of [mere] days there anymore, \qac ǁ\qac* And an aged man who does not complete his days, \qac ǁ\qac* For the youth dies one hundred years old, \qac ǁ\qac* And the sinner, one hundred years old, is lightly esteemed.
\v 21 And they have built houses, and inhabited, \qac ǁ\qac* And planted vineyards, and eaten their fruit.
\v 22 They do not build, and another inhabit, \qac ǁ\qac* They do not plant, and another eat, \qac ǁ\qac* For as the days of a tree [are] the days of My people, \qac ǁ\qac* And My chosen wear out the work of their hands.
\v 23 They do not labor for a vain thing, \qac ǁ\qac* Nor do they bring forth for trouble, \qac ǁ\qac* For they [are] the seed of the blessed of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* And their offspring with them.
\v 24 And it has come to pass, \qac ǁ\qac* They do not yet call, and I answer, \qac ǁ\qac* They are yet speaking, and I hear.
\v 25 Wolf and lamb feed as one, \qac ǁ\qac* And a lion eats straw as an ox, \qac ǁ\qac* As for the serpent—its food [is] dust, \qac ǁ\qac* They do no evil, nor destroy, \qac ǁ\qac* In all My holy mountain,” said \nd Yhwh\nd*!

\v 1 Thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*: “The heavens [are] My throne, \qac ǁ\qac* And the earth My footstool, \qac ǁ\qac* Where [is] this—the house that you build for Me? And where [is] this—the place—My rest?
\v 2 And My hand has made all these, \qac ǁ\qac* And all these things are,” \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*! “And to this one I look attentively, \qac ǁ\qac* To the humble and bruised in spirit, \qac ǁ\qac* And who is trembling at My word.
\v 3 Whoever slaughters the ox strikes a man, \qac ǁ\qac* Whoever sacrifices the lamb beheads a dog, \qac ǁ\qac* Whoever is bringing up a present—The blood of a sow, \qac ǁ\qac* Whoever is making mention of frankincense, \qac ǁ\qac* Is blessing iniquity. Indeed, they have fixed on their own ways, \qac ǁ\qac* And their soul has delighted in their abominations.
\v 4 I also—I fix on their distress, \qac ǁ\qac* And I bring in their fears to them, \qac ǁ\qac* Because I have called, and there is none answering, \qac ǁ\qac* I spoke, and they have not listened, \qac ǁ\qac* And they do evil in My eyes, \qac ǁ\qac* And on that which I did not desire—fixed.”
\v 5 Hear a word of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* You who are trembling at His word: “Your brothers who are hating you, \qac ǁ\qac* Who are driving you out for My Name’s sake, have said, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* is honored, and we look on your joy, \qac ǁ\qac* But they are ashamed.”
\v 6 A voice of noise from the city, \qac ǁ\qac* A voice from the temple, \qac ǁ\qac* The voice of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* Giving repayment to His enemies.
\v 7 “Before she is pained she has brought forth, \qac ǁ\qac* Before a pang comes to her, \qac ǁ\qac* She has delivered a male.
\v 8 Who has heard anything like this? Who has seen anything like these? Is earth caused to bring forth in one day? Is a nation born at once? For she has been pained, \qac ǁ\qac* Zion has also borne her sons.
\v 9 Do I bring to the birth, \qac ǁ\qac* And not cause to bring forth?” says \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* “Am I not He who is causing to beget? I have also restrained,” said your God.
\v 10 “Rejoice with Jerusalem, \qac ǁ\qac* And be glad in her, all you loving her, \qac ǁ\qac* Rejoice with her for joy, \qac ǁ\qac* All you who are mourning for her,
\v 11 So that you suckle, and have been satisfied, \qac ǁ\qac* From the breast of her consolations, \qac ǁ\qac* So that you wring out, and have delighted yourselves \qac ǁ\qac* From the abundance of her glory.”
\v 12 For thus said \nd Yhwh\nd*: “Behold, I am stretching out to her peace as a river, \qac ǁ\qac* And the glory of nations as an overflowing stream, \qac ǁ\qac* And you have sucked, \qac ǁ\qac* You are carried on the side, \qac ǁ\qac* And you are dandled on the knees.
\v 13 As one whom his mother comforts, so do I comfort you, \qac ǁ\qac* Indeed, you are comforted in Jerusalem.”
\v 14 And you have seen, and your heart has rejoiced, \qac ǁ\qac* And your bones flourish as tender grass, \qac ǁ\qac* And the hand of \nd Yhwh\nd* has been known to His servants, \qac ǁ\qac* And He has been indignant with His enemies.
\v 15 For behold, \nd Yhwh\nd* comes in fire, \qac ǁ\qac* And His chariots as a windstorm, \qac ǁ\qac* To refresh His anger in fury, \qac ǁ\qac* And His rebuke in flames of fire.
\v 16 For by fire and by His sword, \qac ǁ\qac* \nd Yhwh\nd* does judgment with all flesh. And many have been \nd Yhwh\nd*’s pierced ones.
\v 17 “Those sanctifying and cleansing themselves [to go] to the gardens, \qac ǁ\qac* One after another in the midst, \qac ǁ\qac* Eating flesh of the sow, \qac ǁ\qac* And of the abomination, and of the muroid, \qac ǁ\qac* Are consumed together,” \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 18 “And I—their works and their thoughts, \qac ǁ\qac* I come to gather all the nations and tongues, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have come and seen My glory.
\v 19 And I have set a sign among them, \qac ǁ\qac* And have sent out of them those escaping to the nations \qac ǁ\qac* (Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawing bow, Tubal and Javan, the islands that are far off), \qac ǁ\qac* Who have not heard My fame, nor seen My glory, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have declared My glory among nations.
\v 20 And they have brought all your brothers out of all the nations, \qac ǁ\qac* A present to \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* On horses, and on chariot, and on litters, \qac ǁ\qac* And on mules, and on dromedaries, \qac ǁ\qac* To My holy mountain Jerusalem,” said \nd Yhwh\nd*, “As the sons of Israel bring the present in a clean vessel, \qac ǁ\qac* Into the house of \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 21 And I also take of them for priests, \qac ǁ\qac* For Levites,” said \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 22 “For as the new heavens and the new earth that I am making, \qac ǁ\qac* Are standing before Me,” \qac ǁ\qac* A declaration of \nd Yhwh\nd*, \qac ǁ\qac* “So your seed and your name remain.
\v 23 And it has been from month to month, \qac ǁ\qac* And from Sabbath to Sabbath, \qac ǁ\qac* All flesh come to bow themselves before Me,” said \nd Yhwh\nd*.
\v 24 “And they have gone forth, \qac ǁ\qac* And looked on the carcasses of the men \qac ǁ\qac* Who are transgressing against Me, \qac ǁ\qac* For their worm does not die, \qac ǁ\qac* And their fire is not quenched, \qac ǁ\qac* And they have been an abhorrence to all flesh!”
